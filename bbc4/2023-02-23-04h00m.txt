 The World's Radio Station. In the late 70s, a bunch of young Polish guys who
were fed up with life under communism came up with a grand plan. They would make
themselves some canoes and go whitewater kayaking in South America. Nobody could
imagine that at the moment when there were shortages of food that we can mount
an expedition to Argentina. It was like saying today in the student club, okay,
let's go to the moon. They blacked a travel permit, borrowed a military truck
and said their goodbyes. I left behind my mother, my sister, my girlfriend and I
was thinking, gee, a few months and I'll be back home. But while they battled
for survival on some of the toughest rivers in the world, Poland was changing
and their lives could never be the same again. The armed forces now rule in
Poland with martial law and the threat of execution for those who break it.
Soviets' solidarity and Eskimo roles on outlook after the international news.
BBC News. Hello, I'm Gareth Barlow. The head of the United Nations has condemned
Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an affront to the world's conscience. And Tony
Guterres was speaking at a special meeting of the UN General Assembly in New
York. It's debating a motion tabled by Kiev's allies nearly a year after the
invasion began, calling for Russia to pull out of Ukraine immediately and
unconditionally. The Kremlin's ambassador accused the West of wanting to defeat
Russia at any cost. North America correspondent Nada Tofik was listening. I
think what diplomats will tell you is they're under no illusions that this will
change anything on the ground. In fact, if you listen to what the Russian
ambassador Vasilina Benzier said in the hall, he urged member states not to
support the resolution, saying it wouldn't be helpful to ease the tensions
between Russia and the West. But what diplomats say is that it's important with
the one year anniversary coming up. For the nations of the world to really take
a stand in protection of the UN Charter. The Biden administration says it's
extremely concerned by levels of violence in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
The State Department spokesman Ned Price made the remark after a raid by Israeli
troops in Nablus left 11 Palestinians dead and about 100 wounded. Several
Palestinian gunmen were among those killed, as well as civilians. Mr. Price
called for calm. We had productive conversations in recent days with the parties
and U.S. regional partners in support of efforts to prevent further violence. We
are deeply concerned that the impact of today's raid could set back efforts
aimed at restoring calm for both Israelis and Palestinians. Today's events
further underscore the urgent need for both sides to work together to improve
the security situation in the West Bank. A court in California has sentenced a
man convicted of killing the American hip-hop star Nipsey Hussle to a minimum of
60 years in jail. Eric Holder was shot the rapper four years ago in Los Angeles.
He was found guilty in July of first-degree murder, with additional sentences
for using a gun and wounding two other men. District Attorney John McKinney said
Nipsey Hussle was a role model to the community. Nipsey Hussle meant a lot, not
just to L.A. County and the nation in some sense, and had fans around the world,
but to the community where he was from. He was a leader. He was an inspiring
figure. He was neighborhood Nip. The Grammys didn't mean anything. The art, the
record sales, the money didn't mean anything to the people there. He meant
something to them. A TV news journalist has been shot dead while working at the
scene of a murder in the US state of Florida. A nine-year-old girl was also
killed inside a nearby house. Police say the motive for the attacks near Orlando
is unclear. They've arrested a 19-year-old suspect. You're listening to the
latest World News from the BBC. Media reports in the United States say the
daughter and son-in-law of Donald Trump have been summoned to testify before a
federal grand jury. They say Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have been called to
give evidence on the former president's role in the storming of the US Congress
two years ago. Hundreds of rescue workers in northern China are attempting to
reach more than 50 minors still trapped in an opencast culprit that collapsed on
Wednesday. Two people are known to have died, but six others have been rescued
so far. Brazil says it will suspend beef exports to its biggest market, China,
from Thursday after fighting a single case of mad cow disease. The agricultural
minister said a sample had been sent to the World Organization for Animal Health
for further checks. The British government has announced plans to make major
changes to the way English football is governed, including setting up an
independent regulator. With more details, Dan Roman has this report. The
government is now using a greater share of the Premier League's record wealth
and the FA pushing for more funding for grassroots football. The regulator could
also intervene to decide how much money flows down the pyramid. Researchers say
a 54,000-year-old cave site in southern France holds evidence that the first
modern humans to reach Europe hunted with bows and arrows. The use of such
weapons on the continent was previously thought to have been far more recent.
Tiny fragments of flint arrowheads were discovered during excavations. BBC News.
It wasn't until May 1981 that anyone was crazy enough to try. The five cheery
Polish men who rocked up with their homemade gear frankly had no idea what they
were getting into. They'd set off from communist Poland two years previously,
full of bravado, but emerged from the Kolkor Valley, very much the worse for
wear, into a radically altered world. The young adventurers suddenly found
themselves facing an existential choice. There's is a story about repression,
freedom and making a stand, whatever the cost. Let me introduce you to two of
them. Team leader Andrzej Piotrowski, then a student at Krakow University and
captain of its kayaking club. If you are in kayak, you know, you feel every
single wave, every single whirlpool, every current. You are very independent.
You can explore. And Jatzej Bogutski, who had never been in a kayak in his life.
In my early years, I wasn't really very much sport oriented. I was pretty much
into history, archaeology. I was bookwarm. They knew each other from school
days, but were heading in different directions. Jatzej was a cameraman at a
local TV station. Andrzej was studying electronics. But they had two big things
in common. They were Catholic and they couldn't stand communism. Poland or the
Polish People's Republic, as it was called then, was a satellite state of the
Soviet Union. Polish, they are kind of like less unfoundable of the system. They
have to live under this kind of regime sent from Kremlin. But the majority of
Poles are just Catholics and they hate this red system, which is only good in
theory. In reality, we live under another regime. With my family, we were
absolutely anti-communist. My family induced incredible losses during Second
World War. And then the Soviet occupation of Poland was never accepted. I can
say one thing that was maybe a little crime that I committed. May 1st, it was a
big demonstration. Everybody had to go. There were checking lists of pupils,
students. And if you didn't come, they were inquiring and there were some
consequences. And nearby it was like a communist party building. A big banner on
it, a red banner. And they hang on this banner the picture of the first
secretary of the communist party. About 6 a.m., I went there with a little
bottle. It was full of ink. And I threw it in the face of this first secretary.
The glass fell down. I was running, probably I beat an Olympic record. But
normally it was that we were not obeying. We were trying to bypass whatever was
coming from the top and just trying to be passive. Instead of active resistance,
Andrei found freedom at the kayaking club and at church. The communist
authorities didn't approve of religion, but they couldn't stop people from going
to church and talking politics. Usually we were meeting in some cellars under
very, very old churches. And if some agents were sent to us, we knew immediately
so we were changing topic. But when it was like a clear air, we were talking
about the future of Poland, how we see it, how we dream about free Poland
independent from the Soviet Union. In 1978, a new pope was elected. And Joy of
Joys. He was Polish. The first non Italian pope in more than four and a half
centuries. The papal name he had chosen, John Paul II. Oh, it was amazing. I
remember I was in Warsaw. I hear suddenly on the radio this news and everybody
was jumping on the street from the happiness because it was like suddenly we got
huge hope. We on the way to democracy because Polish Catholic Church was always
backheading with the system and the many bishops and many priests, they were in
prison for mostly political reasons. And everybody knows him in Krakow. You
know, we know him personally because he was a priest. He was the shop as bishop
cardinal and everybody was starting hoping for with his election, the changes
will come. You know, I have this recollection. I was leading a meeting of our
kayak club in the in the student office at the university. Suddenly the door
opened and our friend Joseph came and raised his hands up and said Habemus
papam. So it was silence. And then incredible joy, incredible joy. It was like a
spark. We're just embracing each other. We just closed this meeting. We left
stuff and we run on the streets. We run to the main square. It was hundreds of
thousands of people. It was a festival. Everybody was feeling that that's the
end of communist for Poland, that the now Poland has voice, has diplomacy, which
is independent from Kremlin. So this was how the world looked to these young
idealists in 1979. Poland was on its knees. The shelves were empty. The politics
were bankrupt. They were desperate to experience another way of life. And in the
case of Andre and his fellow student kayakers, desperate to to escape what the
authorities had in mind for them. In communist Poland, every graduate were
getting a ticket to go and work somewhere. It was not your choice. They were
sending you to some factory, to some business, and you were working for four or
five years just to pay for free studies. So we were really scared to think about
it or being taken to the army. So for the last two years, we just started
thinking about big, you know, expeditions. So first we went twice to what was
then Yugoslavia, to Balkans. And one of our friends stand up and he said, hey,
why don't we go to Argentina? You know, another shock. Nobody could imagine that
at the moment when Kommispran was scrambling, there were shortages of food that
we can mount an expedition to Argentina. It was like saying today in the student
club, OK, let's go to the moon. But, you know, we created the best kind of club
in Poland. We were winning in some competitions. So let's say regime accepted us
for the reason to use us as a good PR for the world. The problem was with money.
Polish money was worthless. My father in the best time was earning a good
salary, which was equivalent of thirty six American dollars a month. And now we
are going to the dollar zone without money. You know, that was our big problem.
So you got the authorities on board because they saw in you an opportunity to be
ambassadors for Poland. But Jatsek, you went to Kayaka. So, you know, how were
you going to be part of this trip? Oh, it was kind of interesting moment. I
remember this day changed my life. I was coming back from my daily job at Polish
TV station and I was using. I remember trolley number twenty one. And suddenly,
Angé jumped into this trolley car and they say, hey, Jatsek, how are you doing?
Ready to go to Argentina with us to become a man. I say yes, immediately,
immediately, because I love this idea, even without knowing too many details.
One thing must have occurred to you on the spot, though, which is you were going
to have to spend a lot of time on really quite dangerous water and you didn't
know what you were doing. I mean, was this not something that kind of occurred
to you to maybe worry about or hesitate? Although I wasn't really big guy and
I'm not I'm kind of short man, I was kind of fearless, you know, I wasn't really
good swimmer, but I was never afraid of, you know, and maybe it was kind of
stupid, but I feel invincible. I was ready for this adventure. Ready for it, but
quite a lot of preparations to do. I mean, you got the visas, which is which was
a miracle in itself, but then you also needed transport. How were you going to
get transport? You know, I said that there were shortages of everything. And to
get something like a car, you had to get a special ticket from institution, from
factory. In this case, our university applied to the factory. But the response
was, yes, fine. OK, we put you on the queue online, but you have to wait about
two years. So we send our most handsome gentleman. His name is Piotr. To the
factory. He started the investigation and he found out that the director of the
factory has a beautiful daughter. It's just a criminal story. You know, it's
like he just spent some time with her and he then went, you know, this relation
was closer. He just explained to her that we need a truck now, not in two years.
And, you know, who can say no to the daughter? So, you know, everything what was
happening was just like a little, little miracle. We we make this impossible
dream possible. These guys did this amazing job. They basically got the car,
special six wheel truck named Star. And somehow they got special voucher which
allowed this this car to be used for expedition and to be returned after six or
one year time. And also we got like few tons of food, canned food, military
food. Even bread was in cans. And also we we make kayaks. They were fiberglass
kayaks. Not the best ones, but they were OK. You know, the but problem is when
you hit the big rock of any rock, you know, you break this thing. And after
this, you have to spend a few hours to fix this thing, putting special patches.
We didn't have too much really high equipment. Even life jackets we were making
by hand. We were just acquiring materials, OK, materials from factories and
we're doing our equipment. I mean, these life jackets you were making, would
they save your life? Were they were they good? Yes, they were good because, OK,
you can take plastic water bottles and just attach to your body just matter of
their volume. So they were well made, but they were looking very funny. You can
see us in this white, big life jackets. When I'm looking at this, I'm laughing
today. The benefit of hindsight, there were no serious whitewater rapids in
Poland. So when Andre and the crew were patching their equipment together, they
didn't really know what to expect on the altogether more ferocious rivers of
South America. Just as they were about to set off, Argentina reached the brink
of war with Chile so they couldn't go there. Peru was the next choice, but then
Peru started getting politically hectic. So that was also a no go. A planned sea
was quickly hatched to head to Mexico. In the summer of 1979, they said their
goodbyes. I left the behind my mother, my sister, my brother and my girlfriend.
And I was, you know, I was thinking, gee, a few months and I'll be back home.
Poland, we love our country. Yeah. What about you, Andre? How are you feeling on
setting off on your big adventure? Big worry for me was the army because time
was clicking. OK. And someone is getting ready. Someone was writing my name on
the ticket. So I couldn't wait for that. I knew that I'm leaving my country and
my people, but only for six months. That was how long they had permission to
leave Poland for, six months. So there were 10 men who set off with 23 tonnes of
equipment on their borrowed military truck, including 27 homemade kayaks and
Yacek's old-fashioned camera equipment and rolls of film. Full of excitement,
they made their debut on the Rio Piscados in Mexico. We went to Veracruz and
this day was kind of a disaster because we lost probably six kayaks during
within a few hours. I'm still kind of laughing, but, you know, I could do this
because I was just filming from the shore. Were you laughing, Andre? I'm
laughing too. I'm laughing too because I was in kayak and I mean, you know,
River was so fast. We never had this, you know, experience. It was like a
channel with white water. And the problem was not with this because you could
paddle and paddle, but at some point you had to stop and both shores were
densely covered with sugar cane. There was no beach. There was nowhere to stop.
And this water taking and taking you more and more nervous. Maybe there is a
waterfall. Maybe there is some, you know, sink or some cave. So I just let my
kayak go on one of the bands. I managed to catch those sugar canes. I just
ripped some of them off, but one of them, like on the pendulum boom, I was
landing somewhere under the foliage. And then I had to make my way through to
the truck, go back, you know, and this is a semi jungle. So it was incredible.
It took me a long time, one hour or two hours, and then we were just counting
people. We were not counting kayaks. You know, it was near me. It's absolutely
for many of us. Wow. Did that not make you think, well, this is quite a lot more
dangerous than maybe we'd thought through. No, absolutely not. We were
invincible. I was 27 and the world was wide open in front of me and in front of
my kayak. Their stash of kayaks was rapidly being depleted and so were their
coffers. The 10 needed to raise some money and drove north to Wyoming in the
United States, where a Polish friend, Chris, was living in a little town called
Kasper. Local paper published big, you know, article like innovation of words of
pack in Kasper. It was kind of a joke, but we were actually kind of sensation in
this little town on the prairie. And everybody enjoy us because suddenly 10
young guys end up in this town, kind of like injection of fresh blood into this
community. And everybody help us because we need some cash to finance our
expedition and everybody giving us some jobs, painting houses, building fences.
And imagine 10 guys sleeping in a basement of our friend, Chris Murra, and his
wife Karen, she was ready to bring to the world first baby. And it was kind of a
little bit hectic, but, you know, everybody was staying together and happy. I
mean, I've got this picture of you as this, you know, really close bunch of
friends living in the basement, but you were living in quite difficult
conditions. You were going through a lot together and you were staying friendly
and close and charming people all along the way. What was it that you were able
to do? What did you bring to places that people responded to in this way? We are
kind of a very cheerful group of young people from Poland and everybody kind of
enjoyed us because we were also, besides we were kind of explorers, we were kind
of party animals. We like to sing. We actually were a really nice little singing
group. And imagine me, I was a smaller guy in this whole group and I was this
deepest voice, this baritone. So I remember looking for this big guy and
suddenly was this short guy using his voice. We were kind of likeable bunch,
wild bunch. Are you still both in fine voice? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm playing
guitar. So you know what I'm going to ask you now. Oh, God. Do you feel like
singing a stanza of a, I don't know, a song that you might have sung at the
time? We can. I believe. What can we say? What do you want to sing? Czervone
Pass. Okay. Czervone Pass. Czervone Pass. Czervone Pass. Czervone Pass. Ita por
bues. Oh, Czerk, Czerk, you forgot. No, no, no, no, no. Peace, gree, vase. The
kayakers entertained the residents of Kasper for the whole of that winter by
which time their travel passes had well and truly expired and they were getting
angry messages from Poland to return the military truck. So they headed back to
Mexico to put the truck on a ship. But would they go with it? Five of us
returned because of family obligations, wives, etc. and five of us just
realized, gee, this adventure is not ending yet. We have to finish our
expedition and we were kind of stubborn with our decision. They got hold of a
second-hand Chevy and continued south with their spirit and enthusiasm. They
charmed the Polish ambassador in Mexico. He was no fan of the communist regime
in Warsaw either. And he introduced them to high society in Mexico. A tourism
minister gave them an official letter of support and ten thousand dollars to
document Mexico's rivers. The trip was back on. They drove and kayaked through
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, got a boat from Panama to Ecuador and finally
they reached Peru and the Colca, this unexplored river in one of the world's
deepest canyons. The place is a crack in the earth mantle between two tectonic
plates filled with water. We started at 2,200 meters above sea level and we
finished in 30 days at 800 meters. So this is more than one mile vertical drop
on the distance of 100 kilometers. We knew that this drop will cause waterfalls.
When I saw this river from Cessna, it's a horror. Some walls are even curving
and covering the view on the water. You don't know what is below. One of these
walls on the right hand side is over 4,000 meters tall from the river. So when
we saw rocks falling, they were falling for minutes. They were rolling down in
dust for minutes. And that also means that there is no way out. If you run into
difficulties, if you break a leg or whatever... You have to climb like for two
days you have to carry water and you have to have a container to carry water. We
didn't have such stuff. We were saying, OK, if something happens, OK, someone
will reach telephone line and will call friends and Polish embassy in Lima. But
nobody said how. It was a little fable. They calculated it would take them five
days and packed food for eight just in case. But as they were about to set off,
there was devastating news. In Rome late this afternoon, shots were fired at the
Pope and he's been seriously wounded. The attempt to kill the Pope happened when
Pope Paul was driving through St Peter's Square in his white open car on the way
to his weekly audience in the Vatican. It was a total shock for us. We were
losing the best son of Poland. It was his nickname at that time. Priest in
Little Town, he lent us a transistor radio. We sat on the parish with broken
windows. It was terribly cold, 3,650 meters above sea level. Our teeth rose in
our canteens and we were listening in the news. And in the morning, the sun came
up and we just jumped on our truck. It was for us, everything was not important.
We wanted to conquer this canyon to sort of balance this incredible loss to
achieve our goal that we're dreaming about for years. And from this emotion,
from this shock, we forgot to buy a fishing equipment. It was lots of fish in
the river and then we were starving. Oh, no. So, I mean, you go off on this
trip, you're in an emotional state. It's a lot harder than you anticipated. And
five days in, by the time you thought you'd have completed it, you're less than
halfway and you're running out of rations. What was the situation you had, so
what was your mental state at that point? No, we were, you know, almost out of
food and you got some eye infection and the bottom of the rat got broken, ripped
off by some tons of water. Morado was kind of going down pretty fast, but we
were committed to still move forward because we kind of promised ourselves we
have to do this for our pope. I was feeling bad. I had infection of eye. I hit
my face somewhere on the rocks under underwater. In addition to that, we were
drinking water from the river. I got diarrhea and then both wisdom teeth started
growing. So I was in pain and I was useless and that was the worst stuff, not
the pain, not the hunger, but I was a leader of the expedition and I was
useless. We have to break for the headlines, but we'll pick up shortly with
Andrzej and Jatsek as they and their friends battle to survive at the bottom of
the Kolká Valley. This is the BBC World Service exploring the seriously fun work
of the Flying Seagull Project. My name is Captain Bash. Ash has been on a
mission to bring fun and frivolity to disadvantaged children, children in
refugee camps, in orphanages and care homes. These kids probably have gone
through some of the worst traumas and they don't have access to counsellors or
therapists. Ash and the seagulls aren't therapists, they're clowns. So they do
what they do best to help, escapism and fun. Give them something to wake up
excited about, give them something to go to bed giggling about, otherwise what
is the point? When the Greek government allowed children in refugee camps to go
to school, the kids who'd been working with the seagulls did far better than the
other kids. If they can believe themselves to be limitless and valuable, then
maybe they can go into the next challenge of their life with that arsenal of
self-confidence. Flying Seagulls, Child's Play, Tuesday at 9.30pm and 20pmt.
Coming up in the second half of Outlook, drama on the Kolká River as the five
exhausted kayakers face their greatest hurdle yet, three waterfalls in a row.
Durek wanted to jump down to the raft, he missed the raft and he fell into the
river. He attached rope to his leather belt, which is a little bit of a little
bit of a little bit of a rope to his leather belt, which broke like a sheet of
paper, it was wet. And current took him. We'll be back with Andrei and Yatsik
after the news. BBC News with Gareth Barlow. The head of the United Nations has
told a special meeting of the organisation's General Assembly that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine is an affront to the conscience of the world. The meeting is
debating a motion calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of
Russian troops. The Israeli military says it intercepted a number of rockets
fired by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The attack follows a deadly
raid by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday. The Palestinian
militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, said its patience was running out. A TV
news journalist has been shot dead while working at the scene of a murder in the
US state of Florida. A nine-year-old girl was also killed. Police say the motive
for the attacks is unclear. Hundreds of rescue workers in northern China are
attempting to reach more than 50 miners trapped in an open-caste culprit that
collapsed on Wednesday. Two people are known to have died. Vigilance has been
held in major Portuguese cities in support of victims of sexual abuse committed
by members of the Roman Catholic clergy. A report last week revealed details
about the abuse of nearly 5,000 children over the past 70 years. Severe weather
warnings have been issued for parts of New Zealand's North Island. Heavy rain
and thunderstorms have forecast to hit areas still recovering from a cyclone
which killed at least 11 people. The British government has announced plans for
major changes to the way English football is governed. The proposals include
setting up an independent regulator which could block teams from joining
breakaway competitions. And researchers say that a 54,000-year-old cave in
southern France holds evidence that the first modern humans to reach Europe
hunted with bows and arrows. Tiny fragments of flint arrowheads were discovered
during excavations in the Rhone Valley. World news from the BBC. Hello, welcome
back to Outlook. I'm Jo Fidgen. Before the break we left Andrei Piangtovsky and
Yatzeh Bogutsky and their friends in Great Peril in Peru's Kolká Canyon, one of
the deepest in the world. They were hoping to become the first people ever to
navigate its river. This was in 1981. But they were woefully unprepared for such
a dangerous expedition. Amita Kayakas from Poland, who'd set off two years
earlier on what was meant to be a great adventure and a way to escape the
repression of Soviet communism. But it was turning into a disaster and the
biggest shock of all was waiting for them at the end of the canyon. If only they
could get there. They'd run out of food. Yatzeh, who was filming the whole
thing, was in despair like everyone else. And Andrei, the team leader, was
wrecked. He had diarrhoea, toothache and an eye infection. I couldn't paddle. So
I was carrying stuff. I made the bend. There was a little path from my one eye
that I could still use. I saw a little greenery. I thought that I have
hallucinations from all these mishaps. But suddenly I saw a cow emerging from
these bushes. So if there is a cow, there must be some people. I dropped this
stuff and I was running back. I was just screaming. The earth, the earth like
lumbus, you know. The earth, the cank, cank, we are saved. In a few hours we
landed on the beach and Rippo brought us food. How good these people were to
just help you out like that. They were scared of us. That was the first thing.
We looked terribly. We just grew our birds. Our clothes were damaged. We were
using alpinistic ropes to put our shoes together. Everything was ripped off and
we were really, really exhausted. So when they saw us that we can do no harm to
them, they just probably decided that something happened. Maybe airplane
crashed. But the most important thing was a newspaper. They brought us newspaper
I printed a few days ago and we learned that our Pope survived. We were crying.
I really moved now when I'm saying that. Somewhere we found a bottle of whiskey
for this last moment if we couldn't go forward. We opened it. We drank it with
our friends. We were singing. We were jubilant. We were so happy. You remember
that, Jatsek? Yes. Oh yes, it was amazing. Gee, because we suddenly came from
death to life. They gave us chicken and they gave us some food and we were ready
to continue with second part of the canyon. You get back on the river, which has
one of its nastier surprises in store for you, which is not one waterfall, but
three that you were going to have to get down somehow. At the top of that
waterfall, obviously there's no way you can go. You've got to go down. But what
emotions were you going through as you faced that drop? I have to pack my
camera. We went down and the second waterfall was really nasty. Everything went
upside down. We were drowning, drowning, drowning, and it was really very, very
tough. But fortunately, this water spit us out from this whirlpool and we
survived. Jurek wanted to jump down to the raft. He missed the raft and he fell
into the river. He attached rope to his leather belt, which broke like a sheet
of paper. It was wet. And current took him. We just threw another rope to him
and we just managed to help him back to the raft that was stopped under this
undercut. It was really dramatic. Were you all thinking at that point, actually,
one of us might not make this? One of us may make it, but then what to do next?
You actually thought that one or more of you might die trying to get down. Oh
yes. And when we jumped the second one, oh my gosh, the pressure of water was
holding us. It was not even a shower. It was an entire river falling on us. So
when we eventually left this place, it was a big boulder. Christopher jumped and
he was holding a rope starting to stop us. Impossible. We were weighing at this
moment about three tons. So he was sliding on the soles of his shoes. We were
pulling him to the river. So we just yelled to him, drop the rope. He dropped it
and we hit the third waterfall just filled with water. It was like six metres.
So black humour was really good, you know, for that. What else can you do? You
can cry, but it doesn't help. So it's better to crack a joke. Well, I'm amazed
that you kept your good cheer at that point. Jatsek, as you said, fortunately
you did all survive and you made it out of there. And a few days later, you
could see the end of the canyon. You had made it 100 kilometres, first people
ever to achieve this. What were your feelings at that point? It was just an
amazing feeling, you know, we were just screaming, jumping. And we are so full
of happiness because we suddenly realised we were first human beings to run
through this deepest canyon in the world. And we felt like, wow, these
adventures really mean something to us. And it was something indescribable. I
was elated, but you know, when we went to shore, it was suddenly such a wave of
melancholy came on me. I was looking back to this canyon in spite of all these
problems. You know, life came back to basics, to survival in good style. OK, now
I just realise how many things we have in our homes, how many unwanted clothing.
Here I had one shoe tied with the rope. I was absolutely happy. I wanted to go
back to this canyon and just make it again. So that was my... instead I went to
telephone. I was hitchhiking. People were looking at me as dropout from Mars.
Took me to first telephone and I called Arequipa when friends were mounting
rescue expedition for us. A helicopter was to fly for us next day. You were
heroes in the newspapers, weren't you, in Peru? You know, you were celebrated.
Yes, we became kind of celebrities in Peru because we suddenly opened this area
of Kolkacenyan, Kolkavalli, became really big tourist attraction after our
running through for the first time in discovering to the world. Were you looking
forward, Andre, to your triumphant return to Poland? Absolutely. But while the
kayakers had been away, Poland had been changing. Labour unrest in Poland is
spreading, with 60,000 workers now on strike. It's basically a simple matter of
having food to fill the stomach at a price that people can afford. The growing
unrest is fast becoming a major political crisis for the country's communist
leadership. A new workers movement had been gathering pace, solidarity, the
first independent trade union within the Soviet bloc. It had millions of members
led by Lechthaw Inse and was threatening the communist order. On the 13th of
December 1981, just days before the kayakers were due to go home, the Polish
authorities took drastic action. The armed forces now rule in Poland with
martial law and the threat of execution for those who break it. Poland is in the
grip of a major crisis. The country's leader, General Jaruzelski, has declared a
state of emergency. At midnight, riot police isolated and took over the Warsaw
headquarters of Solidarity. We are going down the street and they are sending
newspapers on the walls. I'm looking, Peyote is driving and I'm seeing a war in
Poland. War in Poland. War in Poland, big, you know, like two, three inches
letters across half of the page. I thought again that I just read something
wrong. When Peyote stopped on another red light, I see the same. I say, Peyote,
war in Poland. I jump out of car. I just grabbed this newspaper from the wall. I
didn't pay for it. And we started reading. We just stop entire traffic. We
couldn't believe. I saw Peyote face was white like this newspaper, you know. All
our hopes for return, all our hopes for the pope, everything suddenly collapsed.
War in Poland. Lech Wałęsa, others in jail, our friends in jail. And return to
heavy duty communists in Poland. I'm with Peyote in Arekipa. Instead of leaving
our truck, we're buying full tank of fuel and we're running Pan-American highway
to our group. They jump on the truck. We go into Polish embassy and we demand
explanations. Instead of explaining anything, they're giving us official
communique, like three pages of this nasty communist jargon, like in the early
forties, explaining everything upside down, full of lies and everything. We just
threw this paper on the floor. We left embassy and behind it, it was a
television station. We just made a loop with the truck, parked in front of the
entrance. They interrupted their broadcasting, put us on air. And we said what's
going on. And that was the beginning of our solidarity support for Poland. Every
news media outlet, TV, print, you know, radio, they were running after us and
asking questions. We are criticizing this regime and we became instantly
dissidents, which means our way to going back to Poland was out of the question.
We'd be prosecuted and sent to jail, even somewhere to Russia and Siberia. You
never know. And we spent like a couple of months in Lima, Peru, organizing
support for solidarity. We organized big march to the streets of Lima. At least
five thousand people were marching and the future Nobel Prize famous writer,
Mario Vargas Llosa. He helped us write a protest letter to Polish and the
Russian embassies after the march. And also we organized the Chopin Music
Recital, which raised like almost twenty five hundred dollars. And we send this
money to underground solidarity via Vatican. And in this case, we close our way
for going back to Poland. Our march ended up with some riots on the streets in
front of Soviet embassy. Crowds of Peruvian people suddenly gate open and this
water cannons came from inside of Soviet embassy. These people were fighting for
the pope and for Lech Wałęsa and they were suffering. I mean, your your profile
was growing. You were speaking to international media about your views on what
was going on in Poland. Polish authorities were well aware that you were causing
quite a stir. What were the consequences for your family back home in Poland? So
our families, they were interrogated. My mother was told he's not going to never
going back. My name was a race from every possible document in Poland. And it
was difficult for our families. In my case, probably the same people with
militia at that time, it was called militia, not police. They just knock on the
door. My grandmother was left there in Poland. So she opened and they were
interrogating her. They were trying to threaten her. They were asking where
where am I? And then when they were leaving apartment building, it was at that
time that it was a list of occupants with by names and by apartment number. So
they took some knife or something and just erased my name, leaving a hole. They
clearly couldn't go home, but they didn't have permission to stay in Peru
either. They had a few days left on their transit visas for the United States
and raced north to cross the border just in time. They were allowed to stay for
six months and ended up getting political asylum. You've gone from these young
adventurers to heroes to dissidents to refugees in a really short space of time.
And now here you are in a, you know, in a foreign country having to build new
lives away from the country you'd expected to be going home to. How were you
feeling about that? First of all, it was kind of depressing feeling because we
suddenly cut our ties with our our native country and we didn't know if we ever
can go back because, you know, political situation was really tough over there.
And but we have to build our lives slowly, slowly. We spend one month in New
York and finally we end up in Casper, Wyoming, where we, our good friends and
Marinowski family, Polish family, they embrace us and help us with first steps
in this American life. And we slowly build our lives. It was a difficult
process, but we survived. Andrey got a scholarship to complete his Masters in
Maths at the University of Ohio. He became a teacher in New York City. Jatsek
got a tempting job offer to be a news cameraman for a TV station in Casper,
Wyoming. I say in my still very broken English, say yes, and Irene never looked
back. You both found your feet in the United States and started building a new
life. And it was several more years, 1989, before communism fell in Poland and
you were able to go back. Yes, I was I was like probably one week after Poland
became democratic. I went to Poland, see my family was amazing, great feeling.
And I had a chance to even meet with first Polish premier Mazowiecki. Poland was
finally free of Russian influence, was becoming a democratic country, was
something, you know, I can even describe properly. You see, my mother, my
brother, my sister, my cousins, was something really amazing. After 10 years.
After 10 years. Andrey, how was it for you going back to Poland? I went to
Berlin first, I paid one Deutsche Mark and they lent me a sledgehammer and I was
crushing the wall. The Berlin Wall. Berlin Wall just to release and end up this
part of my life, you know, this part under communist pressure and just
repressions. At that moment, I felt that I'm really free man and I could go and
see my family, my cousins, everybody. But both Jacek and Andrey chose to stay in
the United States, as did the others. They still meet up to go kayaking. This is
great tradition. I named this Potomac around the world and for almost like 25
years, we were meeting in the rest of Virginia where our buddy Piotr Milinski
leaves. And he's inviting us every year around Labor Day. And we meet for like
three, four days and we do kayaking on Potomac and a few parties. And it's
really great camaraderie. And I feel like we are like a band of brothers and we
are still keeping in touch on a daily basis. You set out on this journey more
than 40 years ago and completed it 40 years ago. Obviously, it didn't work out
as you planned at all. But I wonder now looking back whether you would have made
the same decision knowing what you know to set off for South America and leave
your home. Yes. In my case, I will do the same in in split second. No regrets. I
would do the same also in split second. It was the best part of my life, total
freedom. We were marking point on the map and going there. Nobody was telling us
what to do. We were listening to ourselves. We didn't have responsibilities,
families, children, money, mortgages and all this stuff. If I could turn the
clock, I would do it immediately. Andrei Pianktovsky and Yatsik Bugutsky on the
kayaking trip that changed their lives. They were speaking to Outlook in 2021. A
documentary has since been made about the group featuring the footage that
Yatsik shot. It's called Godspeed Los Pollakos. Thanks for listening. Invented
the explosive. Undercover bomb attacks. It was high strength, impossible to
detect using X-rays or sniffer dogs, yet stable enough to handle. It was
developed by two Czech chemists, Radim Fugatko and Stanislav Brebere, in a small
town, Semkin, which gave its name to the product. Mereislav Brebere remembers
how proud his brother was of his invention. He was overjoyed. He told me that he
could casually carry Semtex in his pocket and that it wouldn't explode by itself
without a detonator. He also said that you could attach 100 grams of the
explosive to a car and then easily blow it up from a distance, which was later
on misused. They got around 15,000 Czechoslovak crowns for the invention. That
amount of money was equal to the average annual salary in communist
Czechoslovakia, a huge bonus. The initial task assigned to the scientists at the
research unit in Semkin by the Czechoslovak army in the early 1950s was to
develop a plastic explosive that would be extremely powerful, but which at the
same time could resist machine gun fire without exploding. Stanislav Brebere, a
talented chemist, was considered crucial for this enterprise. He was called back
from the regular military service, but they asked him to return to Semkin so
that he could continue his research of explosives. The scientists had to come up
with a new plastic explosive that could be easily manufactured from cheap
domestic resources. Rival plastic explosives such as C4 were being developed on
the other side of the Iron Curtain in the UK and the US at around the same time.
But Semtex was waterproof, very malleable and had a long shelf life. Evo Varga
is a leading specialist with Xplosia, the company which produces Semtex today.
Semtex was very similar to other plastic explosives of that time, like C4 or
Formax. But the advantage of Semtex was how sticky it was. You could attach it
to almost any surface and the fact that it was resistant to both low and high
temperatures. Semtex is easily moldable even in minus 15 degrees Celsius or plus
50 degrees Celsius. Czechoslovakia started manufacturing Semtex in 1964. It was
widely exported to countries allied to the Soviet bloc for a broad range of
purposes, from commercial blasting works and quarries or on building sites to
clearing mines. Semtex was primarily used by the Czechoslovak army, but it was
also sold to the armies of the Warsaw Pact countries like Hungary and East
Germany. And after that, it was delivered to North Vietnam as well. But those
were small quantities, like one ton of the explosives. In the 1980s, the Czech
company specialising in defence equipment exports started selling Semtex to
Libya to support the building boom there. Libya, however, sold on substantial
amounts of Semtex to the Irish Republican Army, or IRA, which in the 1970s and
80s was fighting a violent campaign to drive British troops out of Northern
Ireland. The Libyan sales could have been an act of revenge after the UK allowed
the USA to launch attacks against Libya from a British airbase in 1986. Then, on
the 21st of December 1988, a Pan Am passenger plane flying from Frankfurt to
Detroit was blown apart by a bomb. All 259 people on board were killed and
another 11 died in the small Scottish town of Lockerbie, where the wreckage came
down. This is the little border town of Lockerbie tonight. The air is thick with
smoke, flames and the smell of aviation fuel. A crater 20 feet deep marks the
spot near the main Glasgow road where the jumbo jet came down. All four engines
have also been identified in Lockerbie itself, but it now seems that it was in
the countryside 17 miles from the town that the search teams found the luggage
debris containing traces of plastic explosive. When it was suggested that Semtex
had been used in the Lockerbie bombing, Stanislav Breberer was needed again. My
brother, who was about to retire, was sent there to find out whether Semtex was
really to blame or whether there was some other explosive used. He said they
couldn't prove that Semtex was used. In 2003, the Libyan leader, Colonel
Gaddafi, accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing, but Semtex was never
confirmed as the substance used to bring down the Boeing 747. Bartlav Habel, the
first post-Soviet president of Czechoslovakia, nonetheless expressed disgust
over the Semtex exports to authoritarian regimes. The former regime exported a
thousand tons of Semtex to Libya, and yet 200 grams are enough to blow up an
aircraft. This means that now world terrorism has enough supplies of Semtex to
last 150 years. Semtex was completely banned for exports in 1989. Exposia later
actively participated in finding ways of marking its explosives, and in 1991 it
voluntarily started adding an organic compound called DMNB, which helps sniffer
dogs to detect it. The content of the explosive has undergone many changes over
the years, but the one thing that hasn't changed is the name Semtex. The name
Semtex is very nice. It's actually very hard to come up with a name for an
explosive. The name Semtex has become infamous. Sadly, whenever there is a
plastic explosive used in a terror attack, Semtex gets the blame, and that's how
it got its bad reputation. Ironically, the creator of Semtex, Stanislav
Breberer, never wanted to be a chemist in the first place, and after secondary
school, he had considered taking a degree in philosophy. It was his son's
teacher who talked him into studying chemistry instead. As his brother points
out, literature remained his great passion for the rest of his life. He loved
reading. He had a large library. He was interested in history, modern history.
That was his passion. When he was a student, he even tried writing. He wrote
poems. Stanislav Breberer, a quiet family man, didn't anticipate creating a
weapon that could take the lives of so many. However, according to his brother,
he wasn't apologetic either. Well, he spent all his life in research. Semtex was
his brainchild. It made him famous. But unfortunately, people blamed him for
inventing something that terrorists found handy. No, he didn't regret it. Semtex
is still being used. His family was more affected than him, as the media wrote
about it constantly and chased the family. Other than that, I think that he
managed to live a calm life. Stanislav Breberer continued his work as a
researcher at the Czech University of Pardobica until his death in 2012. But
Semtex has been approved for export since 1991, with its sales tightly
controlled by the Czech government. Miroslav Breberer was talking to Maria
Giustapjova for that edition of Witness History, first broadcast in 2018. This
is the BBC World Service, and here is Harriet Gilbert to tell you about the next
World Book Club. A bizarre and quite extraordinary story that challenges social
norms with themes of feminism, politics and sexual corruption. The novel follows
the life of a young sex worker who enjoys great success. We are making changes
