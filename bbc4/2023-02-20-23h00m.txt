It's 10 o'clock good evening this is the World Tonight with Ritalashar.
President Biden pledges his unwavering support for Ukraine in its fight against
Russia in a surprise trip to Kyiv. We report from the front line in eastern
Ukraine about the cost of the conflict. We're in the corridor of a busy hospital
seeing the steady stream of casualties being brought in here. You get a sense of
what this fight is costing Ukraine. Police in Lancashire say they've formally
identified the body they found in the River Wire as Nicola Bully. Her family
have criticized parts of the media. They again have taken it upon themselves to
run stories and increase their own profits. Do the press and other media
channels and so-called professionals not know where to stop. We discuss the
relationship between the press and the police. Scotland's finance minister
throws her hat in the ring to be the next leader of the S&P. Kate Forbes is open
about her religious beliefs. I am a practicing Christian. I practice the
teachings of most mainstream religions, whether that's Islam, Judaism,
Christianity, that marriage is between a man and a woman. What should be the
place of religion in politics? That's all after the BBC News read tonight by
Charles Carroll. President Biden has promised that the United States will stand
with Ukraine for as long as it takes during an unannounced trip to Kyiv. At a
joint news conference with President Zelensky, Mr. Biden pledged to provide
further military support and to implement further sanctions on Russia. From
Kyiv, he has our correspondent James Mortell's. A little over a year ago, few
thought Kyiv would last beyond a couple of days after Russia launched its full-
scale invasion. It's why the site of the world's most powerful politician at the
heart of a country still at war is so significant. In a reminder that this
conflict truly began far before February last year, Joe Biden and Vollodim is
Zelensky visited a memorial to soldiers who died during this nine-year war.
Another $500 million military package was also announced. While this has been
welcomed, Kyiv is hoping to shorten the time delay between West and Aid being
promised and used. More than 30 countries, including the UK, the United States,
Germany and France, have said that a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes
competing in international sporting events should remain in place. They were
responding to efforts by the International Olympic Committee to allow these
athletes to compete at the Paris Olympics as neutrals. Ukraine says it will lead
a boycott of the event if that happens. Lancashire police have confirmed that
the body found in the River Wire yesterday was Nicola Bully. The 45-year-old
mother of two disappeared while walking her dog at the end of last month. Her
family said she had been the light of their world. They also hit out at the
media and members of the public who they accused of vilifying them as our
correspondent in Preston Nick Garnett explains. The family has said that they
are furious with two news organisations, Sky News and ITV for making contact
directly with the family when they specifically asked for privacy. They again,
they said, have taken it upon themselves to run stories about the family to tell
papers and increase their own profiles. It is shameful they have acted in this
way and they said very straightforwardly, leave us alone. Now it is directly
mostly at the traditional media but also at social media networks as well.
Junior Doctors in England are to go on a three-day strike next month after
voting overwhelmingly for industrial action. The main union, the British Medical
Association, said that almost every doctor who cast a ballot voted yes. The
health sector, Easty, Barley said the announcement was deeply disappointing. Our
health correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson, reports. This is a significant
escalation in the industrial action in the NHS. These junior doctors include the
bulk of medics ranking below consultant level. Of the 47,000 who were balloted
by the British Medical Association, the vast majority agreed to strike. The
three-day walkout, the longest single strike in their history, is likely to hit
the already-belleaguered NHS hard, heaping pressure on the government. The
junior doctors are calling for above inflation pay increases, but the government
has said pay in line with inflation is unaffordable and that the action will
mean more cancelled appointments for patients. Scotland's finance secretary Kate
Forbes has told the BBC she wouldn't have voted for her government's gender
reform bill in its current form. She was speaking after announcing her bid to
take over the S&P leadership from Nicholas Sturgeon, joining the health
secretary Hamza Yousif and the former Minister Ash Regan in the race to lead the
party. As Forbes said she had significant concerns about gender self-
identification. Officials in southern Turkey say at least three people have died
and around 200 others are injured after an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4
struck the region. People are reported to be trapped under the rubble. The area
was amongst the hardest hit by the quakes on February 6th, which caused the
deaths of more than 46,000 people in Turkey and in Syria. Our correspondent
Laura Bicker is in Atai. There is fear, some panic, and the small aftershocks
keep coming. Lines of ambulances and rescue crews are trying to get to some of
the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings have
collapsed. A number of structures that were left standing after the tremor on
February 6th have no crumbled, including a bridge. The Atai Mayor has said that
there are people trapped under the rubble. Many cracks and roads have become
deep scars, making it more difficult for the emergency services to get where
they may be needed. A group of conservative anger-conchurch leaders from around
the world have said they no longer recognize the Archbishop of Canterbury just
in will-be as the head of the global Anglican Communion. It follows the Church
of England's decision to allow blessings for same-sex couples. The 12 leaders
accuse the Church of going against historical biblical faith. Supermarkets are
facing a shortage of tomatoes, with shoppers across the UK unable to find them
on the shelves. The issues have been caused by poor weather in Europe and North
Africa, unusually cold conditions in Morocco delayed the tomato's ripening
before bad weather stopped fairies and lorries crossing to Europe. Here's our
business correspondent, Theo Liggett. Pictures of empty shelves and supermarkets
and complaints about shortages of some products, especially tomatoes, have been
circulating on social media for several days. Now the British retail consortium
has admitted that harvests have been affected by what it calls difficult weather
conditions. During the winter months, a large proportion of the produce we
consume is grown in southern Spain and Morocco. Both regions have been affected
by poor weather in recent weeks, including storms and a cold snap. This has
affected crop yields and growing times, making it more difficult for wholesalers
and retailers to get hold of the supplies they need. Along with tomatoes,
cucumbers and peppers are understood to be in short supply. The BRC says
supermarkets are working with farmers to ensure customers are able to access a
wide range of fresh produce. And Professor Dame Angela McLean has been appointed
as the government's new Chief Scientific Advisor. She'll be the first woman to
hold the role and will take up the post in April. She was a member of the
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, an assage during the pandemic and she
was deputy to the current holder of the role, Sepatric Balance. Thank you,
Charles, you're listening to the World Tonight with Ritalashar. Secrecy,
symbolism and air raid sirens, all a feature of Joe Biden's trip to Kiev today.
The president took a 10-hour train ride from Poland to reach the Ukrainian
capital, in a visit which the White House said was intended to reaffirm
America's unwavering commitment to Ukraine's democracy, sovereignty and
territorial integrity. That's a message which won't have been lost on Moscow and
as Joe Biden and Vladimir Zelensky were in St. Michael's Cathedral in central
Kiev, air raid sirens could be heard, not unusual, but a reminder of the
proximity and intensity of the war. As the first anniversary of the invasion of
Ukraine approaches, Russian forces are stepping up their assault on the eastern
city of Bakhmut. They've been trying to capture it for more than six months now,
and Vladimir Putin appears to be pushing for a victory before Friday the 24th.
President Zelensky said the defense of the city would continue, but not at any
price. I'll see your international correspondent Olegerin reports now from the
outskirts of Bakhmut. The battle for Bakhmut is now at close quarters, inside
the city and on the outskirts. Ukrainian troops are still defending every inch,
but the enemy is closing in. It's hellish, according to President Zelensky, who
says Bakhmut must be defended, but not at any cost. The President is now in the
middle of the city. The President is now in the middle of the city. The snow is
coming down now. We're at a concealed position on the outskirts of Bakhmut, just
hearing some more shelling there. We're with troops from the 28th Brigade. Their
part of the defense of the city and Bakhmut is still in Ukrainian hands. The
Russians have been stepping up their attacks. They have gained some ground. But
the mortar team we are with are fighting on, targeting enemy positions two
kilometers away. I'm with Victor, one of the troops here. He ran a shoe business
before the war. He has a wife and two children, one of them a baby just 18
months old, and he hasn't seen them since the war began. He's been fighting
since the very start. And are you worried the baby doesn't remember you? Yes, he
don't remember me. When I went to the war, he was so little, he don't understand
about when I speak in the wider to telephone and video conversation. We won't,
the war is finished yesterday. When will be it, we don't know. We're in the
corridor of a busy hospital. We can't say where and military casualties are
being brought in. In the space of just a few minutes, we saw three ambulances
arriving outside. There were two heavily wounded soldiers, both stretcher cases
carried out with drips in their arms. And there were two walking wounded. The
floor is covered in mud. There's been so much traffic. So many boots coming from
the battlefield. Dr. Kaleaski, first of all, are you happy to tell me your name?
My name is Miroslov. It's almost a year now since the invasion happened and
Ukraine came under attack. Did you ever think the fighting would still be like
this a year on? I thought it would last a long time, he says, because the
country we are fighting wants to destroy us using all its strengths. That
country doesn't have any way back. I've just come along the corridor here. There
are one, two, three, four wounded men on stretchers. They're covered in foil
blankets to keep them warm and to protect against shock. Seeing the steady
stream of casualties being brought in here, you get a sense of what this fight
is casting Ukraine of the price this country is paying to defend its territory.
All agar in reporting from back but Yuri Sacks and advisor to Ukraine's Ministry
for Defence, I asked him about the battle for back mud and reports that Russia
would claim the city in the coming days. In the east we have seen in the past
four to six weeks there was a buildup of troops that was a buildup of mud,
equipment. So this could be construed I suppose as intensification of Russia's
offensive. Whether it can be called that offensive, which everybody was talking
about, our understanding is and our approach is maximizing losses of our enemy
while keeping our losses at a minimum. This gives us time for us to all to
prepare for our counteroffensive. And what would be the symbolism of losing a
town like back mud? We call it the fortress of back mud, but back mud is
Ukraine. We are fighting a smart war. We are not prepared to use our soldiers
cannon for us to Russians to. We keep on preparing for our counteroffensive and
we hold up the enemy for as much as we can where the enemy is trying to carry
out attacks. President Biden was in Kiev today. How important was this visit? It
is hugely important because it sends the right signal to Ukrainians that our
allies are with us. They will stand with us until victory and it sends the same
message with a different connotation to the enemy. Has the US been a better ally
than your European neighbours? I think the correct way would be to say that
they've been a leader on many occasions. They were the first to send Ukraine the
multi-launch rocket systems for example. But the tank coalition, the UK was the
first country to actually say that the tanks will arrive in Ukraine. The
challenge is two tanks. By and large, of course, US by Shia weight on the
international arena is showing leadership on many occasions, but European
countries are very powerful allies as well. China's top diplomat Wang Yi is in
Moscow today. We heard the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken suggesting that
China is considering giving lethal support to Russia. In other words, more
weapons, how concerned are you? It would be not a very good development if that
was to happen. We don't have that information confirmed yet and we will have to
wait and see. And of course, we will continue to speak through our diplomatic
channels to our counterparties in China, whether you're convincing them, and I'm
sure that our allies will do the same. So our president was very clear when he
said that this would not be the right decision by China in these circumstances.
Why do you think Anthony Blinken would have made that public? I'm sure he had
his own reasons and he's on data that he relies on. But as far as we are
concerned, we will just continue to advocate for other countries not to provide
Russia with lethal weapons because we have seen what happened when, for example,
Iran began supplying Russia with these drones, which are used to destroy
Ukrainian electricity infrastructure to destroy cities and houses and kill
people. Just finally, I remember speaking to you and many others in the run-up
to the war, nobody could quite believe that this would happen, that Russia would
invade. The war has gone on for a year. Will they be a second anniversary? I
surely hope that this is the first and the last anniversary for us and for the
whole world. And the most important thing is that we are confident that it can
be the last. We are confident that if we all step up our efforts in terms of
military support provision and all other aspects of defeating Russia
economically by sanctions and everything, this is what our presidents said today
that we hope that this year will be the year of our victory, of our joint
victory. It is in no but is interest to prolong this war, to turn it into a
frozen war. That's Yuri Sack, an adviser to Ukraine's Ministry for Defence.
Lancashire police have confirmed a body found in the River Wire on Sunday is the
missing mother of two, Nicola Bully. The 45-year-old disappeared during a
riverside dog walk in St. Michael's and wire more than three weeks ago sparking
a major search operation. In a statement read out by the police, Miss Bully's
family played tribute to the one who made our lives so special. The family also
questioned the role of some sections of the media during the investigation. Our
girls will get the support they need from the people who love them the most. It
saddens us to think that one day we will have to explain to them that the press
and members of the public accuse their dad of wrongdoing, misquoted and vilified
friends and family. This is absolutely appalling. They have to be held
accountable. This cannot happen to another family. We tried last night to take
in what we have been told in the day only to have sky news and ITV making
contact with us directly when we expressly asked for privacy. Do the press and
all the media channels and so-called professionals not know where to stop.
That's that statement read out by the police from Nicola Bully's family. Danny
Shaw was the BBC's Home Affairs correspondent and he has many years of
experience of covering crime and missing person stories. Danny, there's been a
lot of discussion about the activity of people on social media, criticism of the
police for how they manage the cons in this case, but this was a criticism of
traditional media of responsible media. What do you think has happened here? I
don't know exactly what's happened with sky and ITV making. In direct contact
with the family, but I know that in that sort of situation when the family have
had the worst possible news that a body has been found, you have to approach
something like that with the utmost sensitivity. And normally if you've got a
request for a statement or comment in those circumstances, it would have to go
through official channels and that will be through the police and then the
police might relay that through a family liaison officer to the family
concerned. It's possible if direct contact is made, that's because journalists
on the ground had a relationship with the family previously, but really you've
got to really take a step back and think whether or not the family want any kind
of contact given particularly that when the statement from the police came
yesterday, they said that the family wanted privacy. Neither sky nor ITV are
commenting right now, but in a situation like this, obviously, if it's a missing
person, there is a need, sometimes often, for the police to publicise that, to
get as many people to come forward who might be helpful to the inquiry, there is
a difficult balance in all of this, isn't there? There's a balance, obviously,
the police need the media to publicise appeals and they have done that during
this inquiry. I think what the police don't understand and I speak to many
police officers around the country of different forces that don't quite
understand that it's not something where the media just take a police press
release and put it out there. They're not just doing the publicity on behalf of
the police. The media also have a legitimate role in asking the police questions
about an inquiry. They might want to speak to the senior investigator officer.
They might want to speak to the person that's leading the search teams. I don't
think the police quite understand that there is a bit of a transaction that has
to be a bit of compromise on both sides. It seems in this particular case that
the relationship between the press and the police just completely broken down at
quite an early stage. Once again, it's as if we're turning the attention back
onto the police whereas this criticism was very much of the media. Are there
rules that Levison 2 was supposed to happen? It was supposed to look into the
conduct of the press relations with the police. Never happened. Are there other
rules? There are clear rules for broadcasters. There's the off-com code and it's
possible that Sky and ITV, that there's a potential breach of the off-com code
in terms of respect of privacy. And there are codes for newspapers as well as
codes for the BBC. In terms of social media, that's much more challenging
because how can you stop these TikTok detectives, these amateur sleuths from
descending on the area, coming up with conspiracy theories? That's something
that's very difficult to police and some of that behaviour has been absolutely
disgusting. Danny Shaw, thanks very much. Paid for five days but actually
working for four. That's the principle behind a pilot of a four-day working week
and squeezing quarts into pint parts appears to have been a success. More than
60 companies around the UK began the six-month trial and almost all of them have
decided to continue with this way of working with no loss of pay for their
employees. Joe Ryle is director of the four-day-week pilot and Claire Daniels is
CEO of Trio Media, one of the firms that took part. Good evening to you both.
Claire Daniels, why did you decide to take part of this? How did you change the
way you work? Good evening. For Rose, it was very much around productivity,
looking at ways that we could be more productive as a business and just being
totally open-minded to what that might look like. I think the biggest thing is
that mentality change in changing the way you work and having a mindset shift of
actually the five-day working week model is outdated and people aren't
productive for the full time during that time. When you look at that and you
look at how long at work people are productive versus how long they might be
distracted by personal affairs or things like that, you start resetting the
balance and changing your mindset and going, let's have four really focused work
days and give people a much better work-life balance. So you're doing away with
the jacket on the back of the chair with nobody inside, but how are you
measuring success? How do you know this is working? Well for Rose, one of the
key measures for success was financial performance because for any business
owner, that's what it comes down to. And whilst we were on the trial, we
performed 33% better than the six months prior and 47% better than the year
before. So it seems to me that giving people a better work-life balance than
they were happier employees and they performed better. Joe Ryle, that is
extraordinary. Clearly there is some sort of improvement there. But does it
suggest that actually before productivity was actually just quite poor in these
firms? Well, I'm in the high brain. We have an acute problem in the UK where we
work on the longest hours in the world, long hours in Europe, except for Greece,
or having the least productive economies, all these long working and aren't
actually producing good results at work. And so what this trial has shown is
that of course a wide variety of steps of the economy, four-day week is a win-
win for both workers and employees and a more improved productivity. And so
we'll be really pleased with results. It's a major breakthrough for the movement
towards a four-day working week. We're looking forward to the report being
published tomorrow. But hang on, it might work for some people in some sectors.
But what about, I don't know, if you work in hospitality or if you're a lawyer
or an accountant or someone who has to put in billable hours, how would it
affect you, you're not going to be able to work the same number of hours in four
days, are you? Well, it's not going to be an immediate change overnight for
everyone. There's going to be a transition to get there. We say we want to see a
four-day week be the normal way of working by into this decade. But what this
pilot has shown, this is probably the most exciting bit, is that a wide variety
of sectors we had hospitality companies retail, manufacturing, construction, and
they've all done it in their own way. But they've all managed to reduce hours by
80% while maintaining pay. And nearly every company it took part is continuing
the four-day week in this pilot. I think that's really telling. Glad Daniels,
what did you do? Did you shut up shop for a day or did you stagger people's
working week? Yeah, we staggered. So it was really important to stay a five-day
week company. And we split the team in half. So half of them do Monday to
Thursday and half do Tuesday to Friday. And would people resistant, were they
open to this as an experiment? There was a real mix, I think. The expectation is
that everyone would just jump at the chance. But equally, we had habitual over
workers who were concerned about how their performance would be judged if they
couldn't get all the work done in four days. So there was definitely a lot of
work to be done in terms of people's mindset and giving them the tools and
resources they needed to be able to make it a success. You, I think, have 13
employees. Do you think that made it easier to do something like this? Because
I'm an essentially, you could all sit down and kind of thrash it out, couldn't
you? Yeah, I mean, I can't comment on what the difference might be to roll an
out in a large organization. But it was definitely useful that I did take the
whole team along on the journey with me and could speak to everyone face to face
to ease any concerns and make sure that, yeah, people had what they needed. And
what would you say to anyone who's listening thinking, oh, that would never
work? That would be your one bit of release of key advice. It would be, do you
think you get in the most productivity out of your people as it currently is
today? You know, I just think there needs to be a change in mindset. Player
Daniels, Joe Rile, I imagine there'll be lots of people going into work to more
own demanding change. Thank you very, very much. Three members of the SNP have
now declared their standing to replace Nicholas Durgen as party leader. Health
Secretary Humzer, user and finance secretary, Kate Forbes and the former
community safety minister Ash Regan have all began to set out their stalls and
will be lobbying to win backing from high profile party figures in an effort to
win the votes of the wider membership. And what you might expect much of the
debate to focus on how to push the party's core agenda of independence or
perhaps on public services, it's striking that the religious beliefs of two of
the candidates have already come under scrutiny. Kate Forbes is a member of the
Free Church of Scotland, which takes a conservative position on women's
reproductive rights and the same sex marriage. In an interview with the BBC
today, she made her stance clear. I am a practicing Christian. I practice the
teachings of most mainstream religions, whether that's Islam, Judaism,
Christianity, that marriage is between a man and a woman, but that's what I
practice. As a servant of democracy, in a country where this is law, I would
defend to the hilt, your right and anybody else's right to live and to love
without harassment or fear. The Health Secretary Humzer, user, was asked about
whether he thought his colleague, Kate Forbes' religion posed an issue and
whether he'd allow her to serve in his cabinet. I'm a person of faith myself.
I'll be fasting Ramadan in a number of weeks time, but I don't legislate based
on my faith. That is not the job I think of representatives to do. These are
questions for Kate Forbes to answer. Our party has done well by being a socially
progressive political party. His garnered huge amounts of support by doing that,
and I want to continue to make sure we go down that socially progressive. The
MP, Tim Farron, was the leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2015 to 2017. When
he resigned, he said he felt remaining faithful to Christ was incompatible with
leading his party. His new book, Mucky Business, why Christians should get
involved in politics is out now, and Polytoimbee is a guardian columnist and
vice chair of Humanists UK. Humanists believe we can live ethical and fulfilling
lives without religion on the basis of reason. Good evening to you both. Tim
Farron, you said you faced questions about your Christian faith from the very
first day of your leadership. So leading a party brought your faith into focus
in a way that really, before, wasn't scrutinized on the backbenches. I guess
that's probably true. I also think just to cut the chase that there are ways of
being a Christian and in leadership, where you handle the questions that I got
more wisely than I did. Which would be more? I'm hopeful that Kate Forbes is a
wiser person than I am. Well when you get asked questions about, as I've catered
today, about what does the Bible teach and issues to do is sort of sexuality,
personal morality. A better place to go is to help people to go back. It's not
the Bible isn't as list of prohibitions. The Bible is if you're like a great
love story from God to humanity. And I believe it to be true. And if it is true,
then it's going to change how you choose to live. And it will also give you a
very different worldview than if you don't believe it. And as a liberal, I take
the view that we've got to recognize that there are multiple worldviews and to
be a liberal is to recognize there must be a place for all of them in a
civilised liberal democracy. And it's going to be surely in a pluralistic
society, in a democracy there should be space for anyone of any faith to lead
their party or the country. Absolutely. And the humanists are the greatest
defenders of people's right to believe whatever they want to believe. But that's
very different too. If they step over the border of imposing religions on other
people. I mean, we now know that this country, in the last century's Christians
are now a minority. The reason for that is a big shift towards people who have
no religion. And they don't want to have things imposed on them by people who
are getting their commandments from somewhere else. But what people think
privately is entirely the business. I mean, none of us who do we call ourselves
rationalists. None of us is very rational. We all have different irrationalities
within us. So you don't want to particularly want to pick on the religion, the
religious as being exceptionally unreasonable, but it is unreasonable when you
have 26 bishops in the House of Lords actually deciding on our laws. The reason
we don't have an assisted dying law is entirely because of the religious.
Because for many, many years now, the public have been strongly 80% in favour of
it. Tim, so that's a very new... Has a sort of secular liberalism become
ascendant, and actually that makes it more difficult if there is a perception
that people like you with strongly held religious beliefs might be imposing
those values on others who simply don't share them. Yes, secular liberalism and
liberalism in name only, because I think this assumption that if you have an
absence of faith, you are a reasonable rational person. And if you have a faith,
well, we'll tolerate you, but you're pretty eccentric. And I think that it is
wrong to think. So I know exactly what probably means that she doesn't want
people imposing their religious faith on others. And I always, I hope I do, take
the view that it is not my job as a Christian in politics to legislate and make
people are not Christians, live as though they were. However, to say that a
person, everybody's got a worldview, nobody is neutral at all. There is no
neutrality. Let's establish that for sure. In which case, the idea that if you
have a religious faith, let's call it that, you have to leave that value system
at the door, but if you don't have one, then you can take it with you. That's a
liberal and it's total intellectual nonsense. Polytoingby? Well, I think, you
know, to some extent, he's right that what people think privately is their own
business. But it's the moment it steps over into the public. And I do think, you
know, we have a disproportionate influence. In fact, the 30% of our state
schools are run by religions, mostly C.A.V. and Catholic and some others. And it
is bizarre. So, most people have nothing to do with it. And yet they come on,
you know, that a third of our state education. A very, very polytoingby. Do you
think we pick on Christians in particular after all, Hamza Yusuf is Muslim.
Rishi Sunak is Hindu. Do we, should we look at other faiths and ask how tall are
those faiths are? Of course. I mean, I haven't seen any sign of Rishi Sunak or
Sadik Khan or anyone imposing their religions on anyone else. So if it's a
private matter, that's their own business. As I've said, you know, I don't think
all of us rationalists necessarily, all that rational. We don't claim
superiority, but we don't want anybody else to interfering with our lives.
Simfaran very briefly, do you feel picked on? No. I mean, if you're a Christian,
first of all, you are to live counter-culturally. So if you are not standing
out, you're doing something wrong and our job when we are got out is to turn the
other cheek, not whine about it. Timfaran, polytoingby, thank you both. Douglas
Latchford was an art dealer, but he was also an art smuggler. And now an
astonishing horde of his has come to light in London, a vast trove of royal
jewellery from Cambodia's medieval and Korean empire. Cambodia experts say
they've never seen most of the jewellery before and are stunned by its
existence. The loots now flown from the UK to Cambodia's capital, Penom Pen,
it's set to go on public display later this year. Before the collection left
London, Celia Hatton was given a preview. We're entering a top secret compound
in Seth London. I can say, this is sort of what Buckinghamshire prison feels
like. It's holding long-lost treasures, originally stolen from the Cambodian
temples of Angkor Wat. Eventually, we enter a small, brightly lit room. Inside
Cambodia's and Korean crown jewellery, thousands of years of priceless history,
it was looted and then hidden away in London for decades. You can see the gold
really sparkling. Now it's been rediscovered. We can see a row of crowns, one to
five crowns, and then this beautiful gold cup to think that this is solid gold
dating back to the 11th century. Many of these pieces were stolen in modern
times, taken during the country's three decades of civil war that began in the
1970s. They were funneled into a secret collection belonging to the British
dealer and known art smuggler Douglas Lachford. He died in 2020 while awaiting
trial in the US. It's still a mystery how these artifacts ended up for sale in
the UK. In an industrial area of North London, I meet Brad Gordon, an American
lawyer who's the head of Cambodia's investigations team. He first saw the
jewellery last summer. I was driven by a representative of Lachford family to an
undisclosed location. Lachford's family promised to return his stolen collection
to Cambodia after he died. The authorities didn't know what they'd receive. They
certainly didn't expect to be handed over in a parking lot. I was shown in the
back of the vehicle. Inside were four boxes of Cambodia's greatest treasures. I
felt like pride. Some of the jewellery has surfaced before. Lachford included a
handful of it in a book he co-wrote in 2008. Even after he was formally accused
of dealing in stolen antiquities by the US, he maintained his innocence. They've
seen too many Indiana Jones films. Here he is in a rare interview in 2004. As
far as I know, there is no such thing as a smuggling network. I certainly don't
belong to an smuggling network. Last year, our team traveled to Cambodia and met
former looters who were now government witnesses. They told us they stole items
for Lachford, which he and his network then sold on to private collections and
UK institutions like the British Museum and the VNA. I believe this is the
greatest art crime in history. This went on for decades. We asked the Met Police
if Lachford's UK associates are also being investigated. They declined to
comment, noting they don't identify anyone under investigation prior to being
charged with a criminal offense. So in a very careful process, a headdress has
been unpacked from a box. Since we saw the collection in London, it's been flown
back to Penom Pen in a top secret mission where it's been welcomed by Cambodia's
authoritarian leader, Hun Sen. He's facing another election this year and could
paint this as a political win. So this is on the walls of Angkor Wat. Now we're
looking at what could be the real life object. And on the next slide, Cambodians
want their antiquities returned. After decades in the dark, the jewellery will
soon be on display and in the spotlight. Once again. Celia Hatton reporting. As
we've been hearing, it's almost a year since the full-scale Russian invasion of
Ukraine. And all this week, we'll hear from people who've lost family and
friends in the war. My world tonight, colleague James Kumerasami, has been
speaking to Andri Shevchenko. He's the former Ukrainian ambassador to Canada. In
July, his brother Yev Hen Olefirenko died in battle. He started history and he
got his education in one of the best Ukrainian universities. And history was his
passion. And I guess at some point he realized that there are times to study
history and there are times when you are part of the history and it's up to you
to make some history. And that's what he did. And when the Russians invaded,
were there any doubts in his mind about what he would do? He had been preparing
himself. He actually took some classes at the military academy. He was a
civilian, but there was an option for civilians to take those classes and get
some training. So they won. He just took his backpack and he showed up as a
volunteer and first he joined territorial defence and cave and then quickly he
moved to the armed forces of Ukraine. And how did you and the rest of the family
feel about it? Well, I think from day one we knew that nothing should be taken
for granted and I think all these months we worked about him. We also were so
proud of him when he became a platoon commander. And that's pretty much what we
feel right now. I want to hear a bit more about him. He was known as Elvis
wasn't he? Why was that? That was his co-sign and he had this fancy haircut. He
loved music. He was a front man of a music band. His music wasn't like Elvis
music. It was like heavy metal punk music. I think it was terribly enough to use
it as a psycho weapon against the Russians. Well, it's called an Ukrainian
Chortori. So it's kind of like to challenge the black forces with your music and
I think in a way he felt he was challenging the black forces with his decision
to join their armed forces. And it was a very successful, if sadly a short
career in the armed forces he said he became platoon commander. Tell us a bit
more about what battles he was involved in. So yes he joined the Turtle Defense
first and then he joined the International Division as a platoon commander. He
had three squads under him. There were two Georgian squads and there was one
mixed back. He is a platoon who was in Lissicheansk. He was one of the most
dangerous places to be. And his platoon was one of the last units to leave
Lissicheansk. And he managed to get his platoon out of there with no casualties,
with no wounded soldiers under his command. And he was the first casualty in his
platoon. And what do you know, Andrea, about the exact circumstances of his
death? The Russians were preparing a major tank assault and prior to this attack
there was a heavy shadow. So there was this piece of sharpening which went
literally one centimeter above his bulletproof vest. And unfortunately that was
enough to take away his life. It was a quick death and his comrades were able to
get him out of that place, quickly enough to collect his body, but it wasn't
quick enough to save his life. Do you remember? I'm sure you do. The moment you
heard what had happened, what your thoughts were. Stairable is like, it's like
you feel that part of yourself is cut off. And then I had to take my sister and
Lissicheansk wife and my sister's boyfriend and all together we went to talk to
Lissicheans mother and that was probably one of the most difficult conversations
I've ever had in my life. And I hope I would never have to go up to rain like
this for the rest of my life. I want to end, Andrea, with perhaps a happier
memory that you have of Yev Hen from his youth. When you think of him and you
want to have warm and happy thoughts, what comes to mind? Well, he was a very
fine person to be around. He loved music, so it was always about music. And it
was also about travel. He loved to travel. And after Yev Hen died, the family
made a decision to split his ashes into three portions. One of them is buried in
this very important memorial cemetery down town here and now there are many new
fresh tones there with our fighters and soldiers. And took the second portion
and we dispelled it over this beautiful bridge down town key over the Nipro
River. He loved the place, he loved this city and he stood up to defend the
city. And with the last portion to the Carpetian mountains, he was a great fan
of travel and there was this one specific mountain that he loved to climb. So
the family went to the summit of this mountain and that's where we let the last
portion of his ashes to fly over the country that he was ready to defend with
his life. So for me, I think Yev Hen will always be this fantastic boy with this
extraordinary smile, with his taste from music for life for travel and it's a
great inspiration for the rest of my life and not for many, many people who will
do it. That was James Kumaasami speaking to Andrei Shevchenko about his brother
Yev Hen. Tonight's closing headline President Biden's pledge to the United
States long-term support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. He was speaking
during a surprise trip to Kiev today. That's the world tonight. I'm Ritalashar.
I'll be back tomorrow at 10. But for now, for me and everyone on the programme,
good night. Studio Nurection was by Alison Purcell Davis, the editor was Jack
Hunter. In just a moment, we begin a classic Russian novel. First, those some
advice on things to say to your smart speaker. BBC Sounds If you own a smart
speaker, did you know you can access a whole world of BBC content through it? To
get started, just say open BBC sounds. Then ask your speaker to play whatever
you want. If you could listen to a music mix like this, play Focus Beats. Or try
a new podcast, play Desert Island Discs. And of course, if you want to listen to
live radio, you can just say play Radio 4. Music, radio and podcasts available
on most smart speakers. Just say open BBC sounds to get started. Well, our book
this week is considered the founding text of modern Russian literature. Follows
a young but world-weary aristocrat whose life in 1820s St. Petersburg is one
long blur of parties, dinners and balls. Russian stone reads Alexander Pushkin's
novel inverse, usually known Jägen. My uncle, man of firm convictions, my
falling gravely ill, he's one of due respect for his afflictions. No only clever
thing he's done. May his example profit others, but God, what deadly boredom
brothers to tend to sick man night and day, not daring once to steal away, and
oh, how base to pamper grossly and entertain the nearly dead, the fluff the
pillows for his head and pass him medicine's morosely while thinking under every
sigh, the devil take you uncle, die! Just so a youthful rake reflected, as
through the dust by post-he flew, by mighty's use as will elected sole heir to
all the kin he knew, love millis and wristlans adherence, without a forwards
interference may I present as we set sail the hero of my current tale. On Jägen,
my good friend and brother was born beside the navy span, where maybe reader you
began or sparkled in one way or other. I too there used to sort of forth, but
found it noxious in the north. An honest man who'd served sincerely his father
ran up debts galore. He gave a ball some three times yearly, until he had no
means for more. Fate watched Jägen in his dependence, at first Madame was an
attendance, and then Monsieur took on the child, a charming lad, though somewhat
wild. Monsieur Labe, a needy fellow, to spur his charge excessive pain kept
lessons light and rather plain, his views on morals ever mellow, he seldom
punished any luck, and walked the boy in Leetney Park. We've all received an
education in something, somehow, have we not? So thank the lord that in this
nation a little learning means a lot. On Jägen was, so undecided, strict judges
not to be derided, a learned, if pedantic sort. He did possess the happy thought
of free and easy conversation, or in a grave dispute he'd wear the solemn
experts, learn it air, and keep to silent meditation, and how the ladies' eyes
he lit with flashes of his sudden wit. How early on he could dissemble, conceal
his hopes, play jealous wane, compel belief, make a tremble, seem cast in gloom,
or mute with pain, appear so proud or so forbearing, at times attentive, then
uncaring. What langer, when his lips were sealed, what fiery art his speech
revealed? What casual letters he would send her, he lived, he breathed one
single dream, how self-oblivious he could seem, how keen his glance, how bold
and tender, and when he wished he'd make appear the quickly summoned, glistening
tear. Some mornings, still a bed he drowses, until his valet brings his tray.
What? Invitations? Yes, three houses have asked him to her grand, Sware.
There'll be a ball, a children's party, where will he dash to my good hearty,
where will he make the night's first call? He'll never mind, he'll make them
all. But meanwhile, just for morning pleasure, Badecht in broad-brimmed Bolivar,
he drives to Niebski Bolivar, to stroll about, a total leisure, until Brage's
un-sleeping chime reminds him that it's dinner time. He calls a sleigh, as
daylight's dimming. The cry resounds, make way, let's go! His collar with its
beaver trimming is still the bright with fostered snow. He's off to Talon's
late, and racing, quite sure he'll find Kaver in pacing. He enters, cork and
bottles spout, the comet wine comes gushing out. Bloody rare speed song table,
and truffles, used to light so keen, the very flower of French cuisine, and
Strasbourg pie. Deathless fable, while next to Limberg's lively mould, sits
aninass, and splendid gold. The theatres full, the box is glitter, the restless
gallery claps and roars, the stalls and pitter all the jitter, the curtain
rustles as its source. And there, ethereal, resplendent, poised to the magic bow
attendant, a thrommethed nymphs, her guardian band, Istomena, takes up her
stand. One foot upon the ground she places, and then the other slowly twirls,
and now she leaps, and now she whirls like down from eel's lip she races, then
spins, and twists, and stops to beat her rapid dazzling dancing feet. As all
applaud, only again, enters. And treads on toes to reach his seat. His double
glass, he calmly centers on ladies, he has yet to meet. He takes a single glance
to measure these clothes and faces with displeasure, then trading bows on every
side with men he knew, or friends he spied, he turned at last, and vaguely
fluttered his eyes toward the stage, and play, then yawned, and tailed his head
away. It's time for something new, he muttered, I suffered ballet long enough,
but now D-glow is boring stuff. While the lamps both in and out, still glitter
grandly all about, and while the horses board at tether, still fidget, freezing
in the snow, and coach men by the fires glow, curse masters, and beat palms
together, though Nyegan now has left the scene, and driven home to change, and
preen. Shall I abandon every scruple, and pick to truly, with my pen, the room
where fashion's model pupil is dressed, undressed, and dressed again? Whatever
clever London offers to those with lavish whims and coffers, and ships to us by
Baltic seas, in trade for tallow and for trees, whatever Paris seeking treasure
devises to attract the sight or manufacturers for delight, for luxury, for
modeish pleasure, all this adorned his dressing room, our sage of eighteen
summers bloom. At least three hours he peruses his figure in the looking glass,
then through his dressing room he'll pass like flighty Venus when she chooses in
man's attire to pay a call at masquerade or midnight bull. But look, O Nyegan's
at the gateway, he's passed the porter up the stair through marble entry rushes
straightaway, then runs his fingers through his hair, and steps inside. The
crush increases. The droning music never ceases, a bold Missorca grips the
crowd. The press intends, the hubbub loud. The guardsman clinks his spurs and
dances. The charming ladies twirl their feet, enchanting creatures that entreat
a hot pursuit of flaming glances. While muffled by the violin, the wides their
jealous gossip spin. But what of my Eugene? Half drowsing. He drives to bed from
last night's ball, while Petersburg already rousing answers the drum beats duty
call. The merchants up, the peddler scurries, with jug in hand the milk made,
hurries, crackling the freshly fallen snow, the cabbie plods to hackney row.
Implacent hubbub mourns a waking. The shutters open, smoker sends impelably
shafts from chimney ends. The German bakers up and baking, and more than once in
cotton cap has opened up his window trap. But, weiried by the ballroom's
clamour, he sleeps in blissful sheer delight. This child of comfort and of
glamour, who turns each morning into night. By afternoon he'll finally waken,
the day ahead all planned and taken, the endless round, the varied game,
tomorrow too, will be the same. But was he happy in the flower? The very
springtime of his days, emit his pleasures and their blaze, emit his conquests
of the hour? Or was he profligate and hail, emit his feasts to no avail? Yes,
soon he lost all warmth of feeling. The social buzz became a ball, and all those
beauties, once appealing, were objects of his thought no more. In constancy grew
too fatiguing, and friends and friendship less intriguing for after all, he
couldn't drain an endless bottle of champagne to help those pies and beefstakes
settle, or go on dropping words of wit with throbbing head about to split. And
so, for all his fiery metal, he didn't last give up his love of pistol, sword,
and ready glove. We still, alas, cannot for stall it, this dreadful ailments
heavy toll. This spleen is what the English call it, we call it simply Russian
soul. Towards this our hero had contracted, and though thank God he never acted
to put a bullet through his head, his former love of life was dead. I, too, had
parted with convention, with vain pursuit of worldly ends, and when you jean
drew my attention, I liked his ways, and we made friends. I liked his natural
bent for dreaming, his strangeness that was more than seeming, the cold, sharp
mind that he possessed. I was in bittered, he depressed. With passion's game we
both were sated, the fire in both our hearts was pale. Our lives were weary,
flat and stale. We jean and I had both decided to make the foreign tour we
planned, but all too soon our path divided, the fate took matters into hand. His
father died, quite unexpected, and round Eugene there soon collected the greedy
horde demanding pay. Each to his own, will say they say. Eugene, detesting
litigation, and quite contented with his fate, released to them the whole
estate, with no great sense of deprivation. Perhaps he also dimly knew his aged
uncle's time was due. And sure enough, a note came flying, the bailiff wrote her
sit on cue, and Eugene's uncle sick and dying would like to bid his heir, adieu.
He was prepared, like any Craven, to sigh, deceive and play his part, with which
my novel took its start, but when he reached his uncle's haven, a laid out
corpse was what he found, prepared as tribute for the ground. He found the
manner fairly bustling with those who'd known the now deceased, both friends and
foes had come a hustling, true lovers of a funeral feast. They laid to rest the
deer departed, then wind and dined, and heavy-hearted but pleased to have their
duty done, the priests and guests left one by one. And here's only egan, Lord
and master of woods, and mills, and streams, and lands, a country squire, there
he stands, at former wasterel and disaster. And rather glad he was, it's true,
that he'd found something else to do. Rushan Stone was reading from Eugene
O'Nuegan by Alexander Pushkin. It was translated from the Russian by James E.
