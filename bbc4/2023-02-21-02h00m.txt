 It's 1 o'clock GMT, hello and namaste. I'm Debina Gupta and this is Business
Matters on the BBC World Service. Today we are live in Australia and the US. We
talk about business stories shaping your world. So coming up, as US President
Joe Biden visits Kiev and promises more military and financial aid, we take a
look at the cost of this Russia-Yukrein conflict to America and the world. And
would you fancy paying for a blue badge for your instal Facebook account? Tag
Bill and Emma, Sakeberg is betting that you would. But does this mean the end
for social media free business model? We talk about it all on Business Matters
here on the BBC. But first, the latest news. I'm Stuart McIntosh with the BBC
News, hello. President Valotomi Zelensky has said a world order based on rules
and humanity depends on how events play out in Ukraine. Speaking after President
Biden made an unannounced visit to Kiev, he said Ukraine's victory over Russia
depended on resolve and he saw such determination in Mr. Biden. For his part,
Mr. Biden said America would back Ukraine for as long as it took. Nomia Iqbal in
Washington has more on the President's visit. He and his Democratic Party want
this to be seen as a great presidential moment of global leadership and
strength. It's a trip that sends a strong message to Moscow, but also to China,
which has been accused of supporting Putin. Mr. Biden's words that the United
States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes continue to be fully in
line with public opinion here. But there is some resistance among Republican
politicians who are increasingly opposing continued aid to Ukraine. Rescue
services in Turkey are once again searching for people trapped under rubble
after a new tremor in the southeast. It's the same region where 46,000 people
were killed two weeks ago by a much larger earthquake. Laura Bicker is Antachia.
A number of mayors from throughout the province here in Hathaai are calling for
urgent help. They're asking for tents. They say more and more people are now
needing to be out of any of the damaged buildings and into tents. Others really
feel that this is a place they no longer want to call home. Tens of thousands of
people are thought to have died here in Hathaai province, and I think it's a
reminder again tonight that this is an earthquake, a zone and one they don't
feel safe in. Protesters have attempted to break through barricades in front of
the Israeli parliament, the Kinesit, as MPs debate a controversial judicial
reform bill proposed by the far right back government. The proposed legislation
would allow the government more say over judicial appointments. Tom Bateman is
in Jerusalem. The reason there has been so much debate and passionate argument
and protest around all of this is simply the number of Israelis that believe
that the proposed changes by Israel's new right wing religious and nationalist
government cut to the core of Israel's identity as a democratic country. They
think that the changes will effectively abolish the checks and balances that the
legal system provides against the government running roughshod and doing
whatever it wants without any oversight from the courts. The army in Burkina
Faso now says more than 50 soldiers were killed in an attack by presumed
Islamists in the north on Friday. The military had said earlier, A to died in
what it described as intense fighting in Urdaland Province. This is the world
news from the BBC. The number of people killed by flash floods and landslides in
southeastern Brazil has risen to 40. Rescuers are searching the mud and rubble
for survivors after record rainfall devastated a stretch of coast in Sao Paulo
State. President Lula de Silva visited the worst hit area around the beach city
of South Sebasti√°r to promise government support for reconstruction. The storm's
struck as Brazilians was celebrating carnival. A stroke survivor partially
paralyzed on her left side has been able to move her hand and arm for the first
time in a decade following spinal cord stimulation. US researchers used new
technology to stimulate Heather Renduckley's spinal cord in the neck area,
enabling her to fully open and close her fist, lift and move a can of soup and
even cut a piece of steak. Dr Marco Capogoso led the study. Our patients recover
but they don't become completely normal. So now they can actually use their arm
even if not perfectly. That means that they can recover a lot of independence
and a lot of quality of life just because they can use their arm and hand now.
The researchers say the procedure involves implanting a pair of thin metal
electrodes along the neck to engage intact nerve cells. Prosecutors have
downgraded the involuntary manslaughter charges against the Hollywood actor Alec
Baldwin following a fatal shooting with a live gun on a film set in 2021. It
means that Mr Baldwin and the firm's arm were face a maximum 18 month prison
sentence if convicted rather than a minimum of five years. Botswana says it's
seen a big jump in rhino poaching. The tourism minister, Felida Carang told
Parliament that 138 rhinos were killed over the past five years. Though numbers
dropped sharply last year, official figures say just two animals were poached in
the five years to 2017. BBC News Hello and Namaste. I'm Divina Gupta and you're
with Business Matters on the BBC World Service. It's the show where we connect
with two guests from different countries to talk about business stories that are
shaping your world. So thank you for your company and this are it's almost a 105
GMT with me in the gallery. Our Hannah Alex, Louise and Solmas. So give us a
shout and wherever you are in the world do drop in a high and tell us what you
would like us to talk about at world.business.bc.co.uk. You can also listen to
us on podcast just search for business matters wherever you get your podcast
from and here's what's coming up on the show. It's matters verified gamble. As
the company plans to launch subscription service for Facebook and Instagram, is
it the end for free for all and all for free business model for the app? Well as
you think about it, there's another story that we have from Nigeria. I was
scared. I was you know, there was a lot of trepidation coming with it but I was
confident in my skill and I was fortunate with God on my side. I got a job in my
field. Why are so many young professionals leaving Africa's largest economy? We
hear more from these youngsters in a bit but let's get our guests in. From
Australia we have Karen Percy, Senior Freelance Freporter joining us from
Melbourne. Hi Karen, how are you? Hello, did you know? Really nice to speak with
you Karen. Let's get our next guest. We have Peter Maurisi economist at the
University of Maryland joining us from the US. Hello Peter. Oh nice to be with
you both. Well nice to be with you both as well and I'm here joining you guys
from the UK in Sulford and it's also an interesting week Karen and Peter because
it would be one week of Russia's invasion in Ukraine and we would be talking
about this more later in the week but just as we start this week. I was thinking
about the time what I was doing last year this time and I was in Delhi in India
just going out and doing normal things and suddenly this news comes in and we
took us all by surprise. What were you doing Karen last year this week? Yeah. I
was in Sydney. I sit on the board of the Walkley Foundation which is an
Australian organisation for excellence in journalism. We were a day out from our
big awards so we were having a board meeting and I have a great interest in
Russia having lived there and have friends there and my husband was a
correspondent there so I was sort of watching in the weeks months ahead anyway
but still quite shocked and we did at our awards ceremony pay tribute to our
Ukrainian colleagues in particular because you know reporting in a war situation
is so very very difficult so I do remember hearing during that meeting when that
invasion had been announced. And of course the life has not been the same for
tens of thousands of Ukrainians who've been facing this aggression but beat up
what were you doing last year this time? Well I was trying to figure out the
economic consequences of an invasion because our president was predicting our
intelligence people were predicting it was going to happen that the Russians
weren't bluffing and so I was busy you know I write a weekly column for the
Washington Times and another one for Dow Jones and I was really trying to figure
out what it would mean in terms of agricultural products, fertilizer, oil, all
that kind of business. And the world has seen a lot of that unfold in the past
one year so let's start this conversation with what's happened in Kiev today and
this is where it started. Well that was a sound that greeted US president Joe
Biden on Monday as he left St. Michael's Cathedral in Central Kiev earlier today
he had visited the place and as the air sirens were sounding that was how the
situation is in Ukraine right now still very much the Russian aggression
continues their president Biden wrote for 10 hours by train from the Polish
border to arrive in Kiev to meet Ukraine's president Vol. Zelensky he was
wearing a blue tie with yellow stripes which are also colors of the Ukraine flag
as the country sees one-year anniversary of the war with Russia this week and US
president Joe Biden made sure that his message was clear. Later this week we
will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying
to evade sanctions and backfill Russia's war machine and thanks to a bipartisan
supporting Congress this week we're delivering billions in direct budgetary
support Putin's war conquest is failing Russia's military has lost half its
territory at once occupied young Talmud Russians are fleeing by the tens of
thousands Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided as you know
Mr. President I said to you in the beginning he's counting on us not sticking
together and one year later the evidence is right here in this room we stand
here together well yes President Joe Biden is also promised 500 million dollars
in military aid to Ukraine including artillery ammunition how it says and he
joins this with nearly 30 billion dollars worth of aid that the country has
already given to Ukraine since February 2022. Earlier I spoke with Mark Cancion
a former US colonel who oversaw budgets at the Pentagon he's now with the center
for strategic and international studies to talk about what does it mean for
Ukraine's economy and what does it mean for America's economy. Many people focus
on advanced weapons but it's important to keep in mind that there are no silver
bullets in this war there's no single weapon that we can give Ukraine that will
bring victory victory will come from the cumulative military capability from
weapons and equipment to training that's provided Ukrainians and the morale of
the Ukrainian people but has been provided is the kind of things that the
Ukrainian military needs to continue its resistance and ammunition anti-tank
weapons this allows them to keep going for another couple weeks. Well President
Biden said that America will back Ukraine and its fight against Russia for as
long as it takes now how long can the US government realistically send this
level of support we're talking about billions of dollars which is also costing
America. Well there's no question that the war is expensive over the course of a
year it was about 70 billion dollars including the humanitarian and economic aid
but you have to keep in mind that the US military budgets about 800 billion
dollars so it's not even 10 percent of the military budget. In theory the aid to
go on forever many people have pointed out that there is some opposition rising
both from the progressive left and the populist right so far they haven't had
enough numbers to change the aid package but will be important will be Ukraine's
ability to show success on the battlefield everyone expects them to launch an
offensive leader in the spring if that offensive is able to gain some territory
I think that the supporters will be heartened and be willing to continue the aid
if the offensive fails and it looks like this fighting is going on the same line
month after month I think that the prospect of a forever war will be very
disturbing. There have been calls from political spectrum about the
accountability as well over where this assistance is going. Yes so far there
hasn't been any indication that assistance has been diverted but that is a great
fear there's a lot of money a lot of weapons the United States has stood up some
oversight efforts but I think that there'll be a push to increase those nothing
would be more damaging to the bipartisan consensus for aid and to see some of it
diverted and some of the weapons going where they shouldn't. That was Mark
Cancil in a former US colonel talking about the aid that's been promised by the
US to Ukraine but we still have PETA and Karen with us. So Peter first up with
you we're talking about billions of dollars of aid which is has already been
given to Ukraine and much more will be needed as Mark was pointing out it also
needs diplomacy so that there could be solutions to this invasion as well but
for now what you were talking about last year the impact of this war on global
economy where do you stand today? Well it certainly has had a terrible impact on
agricultural prices and on the availability of food especially in the third
world. I don't know how much longer the Ukraine can withstand not its army but
it's domestic economy and it's people the kind of bombardment it's been taken.
My feeling is is that we give them a great deal of aid but it brings the war to
a stalemate. The West is afraid that if the Ukrainians can strike at Russia the
way Russia is striking at the Ukraine for example we gave the missiles hit their
deposts to frankly assassinate generals behind the border and so forth that this
would bring about a war in your widespread U.R. and in some ways Putin is
holding President Biden and the West hostage. My feeling is that to win the war
we're going to have to give the Ukrainians a freer hand we're going to have to
give them the aircraft that they want the missiles that they need and so forth.
The kind of aid we give in them so far just permits them to hold the Russians at
bay because there's so many of them you know there's so many more Russians. Why
do you stand on this because obviously there are two school of thoughts that
only military aid will not help and the second is that there has to be
diplomatic solutions as well but seeing it from Australia and also from Asia I
would say for a larger part of the world this war is Europe's war. Do you see
this as a war in which you do see global stakeholders coming together taking
sides? I think there's been obviously a degree of coordination and unity and
cohesion on what the response should be but I think we've also seen that kind of
taper away or breakaways over the past year. Australia has put in something in
the order of $450 million between these bushmaster crafts that we've sent, how
it's as drones etc. Some training we've got some of our military in Ukraine
training offices but I think that it's there's definitely a wavering whether
this Biden visit and let's face it we've got to hear from Vladimir Putin soon.
He's expected to give a speech in the next little while and you know he's going
to be saying something about this so that may kind of set the tone as for what
is next because this is clearly a very big signal that the US is not afraid that
keep is safe so you know there are so many messages coming out of Biden's visit
but to Peter's point you know agriculture has been affected dramatically supply
of some foods, availability etc. You know at the Australian wheat market had a
bumper year last year because of the sanctions against Russia but also the
problems with Ukraine getting its crop out. You know one of our biggest
companies grain core is having its second biggest year it'll have a net profit
of $140 million. That's despite significant logistical internal issues with
floods and roads and problems with Australia. So it's complicated we've still
got obviously the issues with oil and gas. Australia's now selling more gas to
Europe but that's putting pressure on prices and Australian politicians are
trying to ensure that that doesn't happen here and of course across the region
as Asia Pacific you've got demands on fertilizer and the inputs for the food
they eat so it's quite complicated and I guess I'm watching for what Vladimir
Putin's going to say as to where this goes and how much longer this goes on but
I don't imagine diplomacy is going to work but I also feel that an escalation of
military you know activity isn't helpful either so it's really a difficult one.
And of course sanctions have been part of a way of putting pressure on Russia as
well. Today US President Joe Biden said there would be more sanctions against
the country but he stopped short of telling and spelling them out for now.
Earlier last week Europe and Union said that they would be putting the tenth
round of sanctions in place against Russia and Peter how far do these economic
sanctions then word because Russia's official figures for economy were released
today and it seems that the Russian economy has contracted by 2.2% versus last
year and this actually is not that bad compared to what analysts had projected
just this time last year when things had started to unravel that if the West
kept saying that there are more sanctions Russia's economy would triple. Well
the basic problem is that the sanctions may affect Russia in the long run
because of brain drain and people leaving and so forth but in the near term
Putin has managed to get his economy organized on a wartime basis that is really
not all that bad in the sense that he's not going to get a backlash at home. I
mean let's face it 2% of GDP Britain's suffering worse than that because of
Brexit. The West seems to think that sanctions are the bullet that will make the
difference and they won't. The war has to be won on the battlefield and I think
that we've become too enamored with the notion that sanctions will solve the
problem. The only way to defeat the Russian army is to defeat the Russian army.
Wars are fought in the present tense and in the present tense. I mean those are
your views. Here's a bigger question also Karen because you have China's top
diplomat Wang Yi who would be reportedly meeting President Vladimir Putin this
week. So it talks about China's now direct involvement and stayed away but it is
not condemned Russia directly till now but this is the first time that you have
Chinese official meeting Vladimir Putin since the start of invasion from last
year and that goes on to say that there are higher stakes. Absolutely and that's
a very clear message that's being said by China as well and everybody's nervous
about China on lots and lots of levels but again I think we need to I guess see
what happens. You know sure the sanctions in reality for those who've been
targeted by them are an irritation. They're an annoyance for oligarchs. I think
he does absolutely right. Russians in the main, their lives have been affected
but the one constant in Russia has been changed. They are adaptive, they're
resilient, they'll just kind of go okay I can't get that in the supermarket I'll
just do something else. So I do think that like I say I'm going to be watching
what Vladimir Putin says more so than the external factors. I think China coming
in is very very important and there will be lots of people who will be able to
read the tea leaves on that but I think this immediate it's not a provocation
exactly but it's not designed to calm the waters either with Biden in Keith so I
think the next little while will tell us more than perhaps this China meeting.
Well this continues to be a top story. Well Peter I have to say this continues
to be a top story on BBC.com and you can read more about that because I want to
get into a next conversation. Just change the gear a little bit here and talk
about social media giant meta which owns Facebook and Instagram and has unveiled
its latest feature for users and it looks remarkably familiar. The new
subscription service called meta verified allows users to pay between 12 and 15
dollars a month to have a blue take next to their name. A lot of people are
calling it a badges. Well it echoes sort of the rollout which is similar scheme
to Twitter shortly after mistake over as well. So I want to actually get your
thoughts on this Peter because Blue badge what you want to pay for something
like this on Facebook and Instagram. I think that organizations will pay for it.
For example if you work for a newspaper the newspaper will pay for it because
the idea of verifying who you are is important and that it will provide that
service. But for the vast majority of you this is going to be a nuisance. Simply
already Facebook is prioritizing posters that it promotes that paid to be
promoted and so forth. Above your followers and I run into that in Twitter. I
log on to Twitter and I get a bunch of promoted posts as opposed to the people
I'm following. What this tends to do is to discourage usage. So what they might
gain on the one hand through subscriptions they're going to lose on the other
through advertising partners because people will log on less. This idea that
they always have to constantly grow. Facebook's a successful business but it
can't grow indefinitely. It's kind of reached its limits. Twitter is not
successful. It loses money and probably will go out of existence at some point.
Well Instagram and it's doing pretty well if you look at the reels in the short
videos of course meta overall is trying to get that loss revenue back from ad
spending. But Karen in your view because this service is being rolled out in
Australia and New Zealand for now. Are there many takers for these kind of paid
subscription badges which also promised some exclusive stickers, some more
access for the story and reels? Not that I'm seeing and that's just anecdotal.
And look you know I think Tequita's point about news organisations. Well a lot
of our news organisations have actually really pulled back from social media
more generally just because it's so hard to predict once upon a time you could
actually rely on the data that came out of the tics and the links etc and that's
not so much the case. I think one thing that's also really worth noting in the
Australian context is that for decades Australians resisted the idea of cable
television. We had a very thriving free-to-air so-called network where you
didn't have to pay for it or you did through your taxes or you're you know
advertising cost for you know the goods that you bought. So Australians have
been pretty slow to adapt to that but now they're very big on streaming but
they're also every Australian I know is juggling their streaming services.
They'll go to Apple at one stage when they know there's something they want off
it. They'll shut that down for a bit. So they're actually managing this. $12 on
the web and $15 on your phone. I don't know how you differentiate because I
constantly go between the people. I mean that was a question that struck me as
much as I would you have. Yeah why are the mobile prices higher than the web? I
mean I couldn't figure that out as well. Peter do you have any thoughts on that?
You know I really don't know why that would be. Other than the fact that with
the mobiles they have to pay the store some money and so they're basically
saying that if you if you do it through iPhone we're going we're going to make
you pay the fee that part of the fee that iPhone is charging us. That's the only
thing I can figure. When that when that when you sign up on the on your computer
they don't have a middleman. Two but a guy. A couple years ago. Yeah.
Australians remember a couple of years ago when our government was talking about
this mandatory bargaining code making Google and Facebook in particular pay for
news content because they've taken away so much advertising revenue from our
traditional media organizations. Facebook shut down news sites and the the
fallout of that was in fact health services local community groups also got shut
down so Australians kind of have this idea of Facebook that it's a bit of a
bulliness threat and I'm seeing you know a dropping functionality and I'm seeing
a drop in certainly engagement and you know I agree with Peter I'm seeing on
both Twitter and Facebook much more promoted stuff and the stuff that's promoted
on Twitter once upon a time was at least I would have caught a quality
advertiser now it feels like it's almost you know fun. But there's a difference
there's a difference age group there's a difference age of age group as well the
the demographic of a p and Instagram and Twitter they're all different age
groups on there. But I think that's very true but I'm sorry Peter you should
I've been dominating you. Yeah 10 seconds each for both of you. But go for it.
Okay Karen all the people are responsible for the other instagram is that how
the day that you accept it Instagram and chasing young people and predicting
them is a mugs game I changed their mind as soon as they say so I'll be very
mindful of predicting too much on young people. All right but we can predict one
thing please to come back after the break and see you on the other side. This is
the BBC World Service with the first of two winning plays from the international
radio playwriting competition. My play is an epic and tartic man on a mission
tale that takes us to a place we could not expect. Snowflories have the grace of
fairies. Small fairies become larger fairies. Dreaming with eyes wide open is
watching them today. Summer here. Let's see forget wrapped up in fur or saw kick
at a distance we look not like men but what do we look like? Allers. Strange.
For covered snowman. With that I can hear is again. This snowman at
bbcworldservice.com Here listening to business matters from the BBC World
Service with me Divina Gupta coming up in the next half hour from Nigeria why
are so many young professionals leaving Africa's largest economy and it's not
music to the years for all the gay pop fans as there's a messy corporate battle
for control all about it after the latest world news. BBC News with
Jutmakantosh. President Valodemir Zelensky has said a world order based on rules
and humanity depends on the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine. After President
Biden's highly symbolic trip to Kiev he said he'd seen Mr Biden's determination
to maintain US support in the fight against Russia. Rescue service is in Turkey
once again searching for people trapped under rubble by a new tremor in the
southeast near the border with Syria. This is the same region where 46,000
people were killed two weeks ago by a much larger earthquake. Three people have
died and 200 were injured. Israel's parliament has voted to continue a highly
controversial overhaul of the judicial system proposed by Benjamin Netanyahu's
religious nationalist government. The opposition has vowed to fight against it
after the bill was approved in a first reading. The number of people killed by
flash floods and landslides in southeastern Brazil has risen to 40. Record
rainfall has devastated a stretch of the coast in Sao Paulo State. There's been
an outcry in Colombia after a former member of the National Truth Commission
went into hiding after receiving death threats. Lena Palacios played a leading
role in the Commission's report on atrocities committed during the long internal
conflict. Two top Spanish transport officials have resigned over a botched order
for new commuter trains. They proved to be too wide to fit through non-standard
tunnels in the mountainous regions of Asturias and Cantabria. US prosecutors
have downgraded the involuntary manslaughter charges against the Hollywood Act
to Alec Baldwin following a fatal shooting on a film set in 2021. Mr. Baldwin
and the film's armor are facing a maximum of 18 months in prison if convicted.
And Botswana says it's in a big jump in rhino poaching with 138 rhinos killed
over the past five years. BBC News. Hello and Namaste, you're with Business
Matters. I'm Davina Gupta. It's a show where we connect with two guests from
different countries to talk about business stories that are shaping your world
and today we have guests from Australia and the US and we will be talking about
why our Nigeria's young-skilled workers leaving the country. Also we'll be
talking about this. It's one of the biggest corporate battles in the Korean
entertainment industry. We get to the details in a bit. We have Peter Maurice
economists at the University of Maryland joining us from the US and Karen Percy
senior freelance reporter joining us from Melbourne and we played this clip just
a while ago guys but Peter and Karen could you identify the song set? Oh one
with ganglin style with us. Yes. Yes. Too recent for me. I don't know about you,
Peter. No, I really can't help you on that. I'm not in Spanish. We've always had
a bad internally here in the studio that you know how many of these both the
songs I mean if you'll be able to identify both the songs and not I'm really
happy. You understand the words in these pop songs. I say goodbye. This is
exactly the demographics you were talking about earlier on this show. Peter. So
the younger crowd. But anyways we get to that story in a bit. First up from
Africa's largest economy Nigeria now is going to elections in just a couple of
days and one of the major issues that's affecting the country in recent times is
the mass disorders of young professionals who are now relocating abroad and this
is causing a severe brain drain and giving employers a nightmare. BBC's BC Abid
Adebai or some of those who have left the country why they took that step and
here's what she found. Nigeria home to over 200 million people with a young
population of over 70 percent. A country regarded as Africans' most populous
nation. At first glance Nigeria has a lot going for it. Talk about a vibrant
tech scene. A booming entertainment sector. A fashion and creative hub in Africa
with a GDP of over 400 billion dollars. But despite that, millions of people are
suffering from alien infrastructure, inequality and poverty and a high
unemployment rate of more than 30 percent. This has forced many young
professionals out of the country as they seek better quality of life. They are
primarily skilled youth including doctors, nurses, IT engineers, university
lecturers and technicians and also journalists like Victoria. This thing about
Nigeria that just puts you in a box, right? And so I wanted to get out there, I
wanted my kids especially to understand that life can actually be different. She
admits it wasn't easy to live lagers for Regina in southern Canada but she feels
she didn't have a choice. I was worried, I was scared, there was a lot of
trepidation coming with it but I was confident in my skill and I was fortunate
with God on my side, I got a job in my field. Exact figures of Nigerians leaving
the country is hard to come by but data from the United Nations shows in 2020
there were 1.7 million international migrants from the country and that's nearly
double the number from a decade earlier. One person who's getting ready to pack
her bags for the UK is Ola, a school teacher in Lagos. Teaching is just
something easy for me, I can walk with children, I is fun walking with them
really but because of the elimination aspect of it's something good is not
really coming out of it, you don't get paid well, you don't really get all the
benefits you're supposed to get so why should I continue doing it? I won't do
something new, something that could change my status and make things better for
me. Now that's the view of some workers, what about how this is affecting
employers? A question I asked the director general of the Nigeria Employers
Consultative Association while it's smart. When you have the talents, those you
call talent, living your business in droves, it compromises your ability to be
competitive, it changes dynamics for an average business because those that can
order cool enhance your competitiveness, they are living in droves, living you
as a person, living you as a person of so many dynamics that are not within your
control. He also told me his last three members of staff in seven months and
that the brain drain is causing a real challenge for recruiters when it comes to
finding the right person for the job. The conversation about our employable are
those that are left, our employable are the context we come up and for those
that will have time on employable, you know, also acts are well as the
educational system and the curriculum are well as it appeared to be competitive
or to be employable. So it's a mass of issues that on the lines that will be the
issue of people migrating out of the country. This is just a snapshot of the
issues affecting the jobs markets in Nigeria. But what would it take to persuade
those who have already left the country like Victoria or change the mind of
people like Hola who are getting sets to leave? I don't know if a change in
leadership will be sufficient. There has to be some drastic change in the whole
of Nigeria for me to want to go back. I want the economic situation of the
nation to be to be well or that to be I and also the unrest that is everywhere
that's political unrest, things have to be done about that. With the elections
coming up in a few days, this is one of the big issues those who come to power
will have to deal with. And it's one people like Victoria, Ola and Wale and so
many Nigerians in a similar situation will be keeping a close eye on. That was
the BBC's BC at the Bay Area, who is talking about the brain drain that's
happening from Nigeria. And it is a global theme as well. Because in the US, it
is a high level country and high income country. You have people coming from all
over the world and I was going through the data of students who actually come to
the US and eventually settled there. India and China are among two top countries
that attract talent. Where talent is coming from in the US. Right. We're getting
talent from all over the world because they come to my classroom was full of
them. And that was great. They were wonderful students. But Nigerians, I have
particular experience with. We have a lot of Nigerians here in Washington. And
once they come, they may go home to visit. But the economic opportunities here
are so much greater. For example, as you folks know, I do a lot of talk, Fox TV.
And the driver they sent from me over these last 10 years is often in Nigerian.
He's a very lovely gentleman. And he just makes enough money here that he can go
home by a house and would have you. And he goes there on vacation and whatnot.
The economic opportunities here are much greater. Now, I've also met others that
had mid-level skills. Not people that come to be students here, but people that
are educated in Nigeria. And for them, often the skills are not as transferable.
For example, if you're a financial analyst or whatever, because the credentials
don't move so easily, the people that are most adaptable, it seems, are the
lower skilled workers and those that come here as students. Interesting. Once
they come, the opportunities here are just too much to bring them back. But do
these skills also translate into inclusive opportunities? Inclusive
opportunities, yeah, I think so. Washington is a very multicultural place.
Whether we're talking about gender or we're talking about race or ethnicity,
there's a lot of opportunity in this region for people. This is a very
progressive area. And I don't mean that in terms of Democrats versus
Republicans. I'm a conservative Republican. And no, I think there is a lot of
opportunity in that regard. And Karen, obviously, high income countries attract
more immigrants, especially from countries with younger population. And when you
see those skill labor coming to Australia, does it also put pressure on
resources within the country? That's been one of the biggest debates. Yeah,
there's a lot of noise around that. You know, that it drives up house prices
that suddenly you can't, you know, drive on the highway and there's no seats on
the bus. But I've actually seen quite a bit of evidence research saying that
that's not so much the case. Certainly there can be pressures on infrastructure,
but that's usually because governments have failed to actually follow through on
their promises to build new train stations or widen roads or to actually build
housing. We have a real issue here in Australia with Scott. We have some of the
highest house prices on the planet relative to earnings because of, you know,
dysfunctional processes through our whole system, you know, land release,
corrupt processes, etc. But there are real issues. I think certainly in the Asia
Pacific region, you know, one of the most evident populations you see across
working outside of that country, other Filipinos, there are 250,000 Filipinos
working in Australia. We see them in our health system, in our aged care and
other caring sectors. You know, the Filipinos has anywhere from, you know, 10
million plus people every year working overseas, sending in remittances, the
Philippines economy would probably pull up without it. But we are really needing
to be very mindful of, yes, in Australia, we talk a lot about skilled migrants,
but there is an impact that happens, you know, to those countries where it's
coming from. We only have a very small Nigerian population here, a small African
diaspora more generally, something in the order of 20,000 Nigerians. But, you
know, let's also think about Russia and Ukraine, millions have left Russia in
the past year. Their middle class, their skilled, you know, opposing Putin's
war, millions displaced in Ukraine who would love to go home, but aren't going
to be in a position necessarily to do so for quite some time. So, you know, that
kind of problem comes from a lot of factors. But, you know, picking up on the
youth issue in Nigeria, I mean, when you look at the age of some of those
election candidates and, you know, there's not a lot for young people. So, I
think that there are systemic issues, there are blatant political issues
involved, but we do as citizens of countries that benefit from the skills of
others need to be mindful of the impact that's having globally, I think. Well,
yes, go ahead, Peter. The other thing to remember is that Nigeria is an oil
economy. Their oil production is down considerably in recent years, but the
problem with oil economies is they don't create a lot of diversity in terms of
opportunity. If you could like connect as the oil sector, it's great. Why is it
that my driver can't earn the kind of money that in Nigeria that he does here?
Now, part of it is level of development, but part of it also is that oil money
does not tend to spread the way say technology money does. And that's very
unfortunate. You become captive of oil. We call it the curse of oil in American,
America, well, among economists. But if you look at the Middle East countries as
well, the petro dollars is what's called there, the way which has fuel
developments. Of course, it goes a lot deeper into that. But I get the point
which you were making, Karen earlier as well, about younger Nigerians, because
84% of them are under the age of 34. And that's where the elections, which will
be around the corner. Now, which are around the corner, now will determine the
government that they choose, which can lead to those opportunities back home
that Peter's been talking about. But looking at Sydney now, and this is a story
that you actually shared with us, Karen, about Sydney hosting world pride, too,
to the biggest LGBTQ plus event in the world. And with more than 300 worldwide
discourse and exhibits, films and rallies, and let's take our audience to the
place. I think that when people come to Oxford Street, they're walking into a
history of drag and queerness that has been established for many, many years and
has a very unique Australian voice. So I'm excited to people experience that.
And also the fabulous Indigenous culture that we have. This is great, not just
for people who are involved, but it's great for everyone in the community,
because it's going to support those of the businesses. It's going to support the
night-time economy. It's going to bring people back to this iconic and amazing
part of Sydney. There is no doubt that this is a rainbow shock in the arm for
the tourism industry. We would not be more thrilled. All right, Green Bush wrote
in the arm. Well, this year marks the 45th anniversary of the first gay and
lesbian Mardi Gras parade and the 50th year of Australian marriage equality in
the country. So Karen, you've actually been there as well and taken part in
celebrations and you're planning to go again. And so I'm truly jealous, but tell
us about the business of it and the fact that it's become so big now. Yes, I was
there at the weekend. I had other business. I was there and some friends and I
went out to a really fabulous live play, a kind of campy take on gentlemen's
preferred blinds. It was really fabulous and a really small theater. Sydney was
a wash with rainbow and a little near Oxford Street where one of your earlier
contributors talked about. But this is a very big event. The Mardi Gras parade
itself has always been a great tourist attraction for Sydney, particularly in
recent years. It's televised. It's somewhat family-friendly despite the fact
that it can be quite risque at times. But world pride has kind of upped the
ante, like you say hundreds of events. This is expected to have in the order of
$75 million in economic activity. 80,000 people coming into the city and then
hundreds of thousands of locals also. And there's a real sense that now
Australian, it's mainstream, the LGBTQAI plus community, you know, it's now much
more mainstream than it was. But some of those could go back to that first those
first years. They called them the 1978s. And that was a real protest movement.
It was actually, you know, a protest to actually exist in the lives that they
wanted to live. You know, it started with 500 protesters in the heart of Sydney.
There was considerable police backlash, in fact, violence, a lot of those
protesters ended up in prison. So there's a real question now about how
commercialized it becomes. That there is still a protest. There's still great
discrimination for those communities. But there is now a big big economy as
well. I mean, the concept is from the 60s in the US, where it was seen that the
LGBTQ plus community had more purchasing power. That's where the terminology
pink economy is it, a large pink economy in Australia. I think it has been, but
I think now that same-sex marriage has been legislated, I think, you know, you
can't actually assume that every LGBTQI plus person is rich. I think it used to
be easier for rich people to, you know, live the lives that they live. But I
don't, I think it's hard to assume that everybody in those communities is rich.
And I think there's a lot of evidence in Australia to prove that that's not to
say there isn't this economy because there are events there are services, there
are all manner of things that are catering to these communities. You know,
there's a real concern though about rain, rainbow washing, if you like, but some
of the communities that have been the most discriminating and the most harsh on
these communities, the police, some political parties, some particular
politicians, even some corporates are now kind of, you know, putting their flag
up, their rainbow colored flag. In fact, they really haven't done, you know,
these communities. Have you seen this paper as well? Rainbow washing the act of
using rainbow colors on everything that you would like to advertise, April, like
accessories, landmarks? Yeah, we have them all over the place, but we also don't
have rainbow flags where things actually happen. For example, I was on the
vestry of St. John's Church in Georgetown when we hired a gay or a rector, which
is the head pastor for people that don't aren't Anglicans or Piscuitallions. And
they're pretty well represented. The reason why the pink economy has so much
purchasing power is because they've done so well in the economy. Now, what has
changed is in the old days, we knew who they were, but they had to be very
discreet. They were in the closet, so to speak. But you know who your friends
were that we gay. Now, you can be openly gay. And now it's not that way every
place in the country, but it's that way in enough places in the country. And in
the places that matter New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, where there's
money and opportunity that they tend to, you know, gravitate towards those
locations. So, you know, in Washington, we probably have a higher concentration
of gays and lesbians and so forth than we would say in Utah, but there are a lot
of opportunities here. And, you know, I've been connected with folks from that
community for about 35 years now. Well, estimates global estimates. It's about
$4 trillion is what pink economy generates each year globally. And it's quite a
bit of money in fact. So, well, I hope you have a great time current when you go
this weekend as well. And enjoy the glamour, the love. And we need more to add
in the world, isn't it? Well, last time, I wanted to see this weekend. I might
catch it in a couple of weeks, but this is the first year. A sitting prime
minister will attend and walk in the Mardi Gras parade. That's prime minister
Anthony Albanese. So, there's been huge evolution that there are certainly
people who think the revolution is not over yet. Well, on that note, let me take
us take us through another revolution. And that one you were about to guess as
well, Peter, but I think it was the cold that got in the way you would have got
the Gangnam style. But let's talk about whether you're a fan of Kpop or not. You
will probably recognize some of these songs. We're talking about the Korean pop
songs that have revolutionized the entertainment industry globally. But now this
industry is seeing one of the hottest core partake of a battle of the S&M
entertainment is one of the largest South Korean entertainment companies, which
has launched many Kpop stars. And hype is known for the popular BTS group from
South Korea. And now hype wants to acquire majority shares in SM entertainment.
They have the support of the company's founder, but this move is being resisted
by other shareholders in the company, including the management, which wants to
go with another Sutter. And this is a complex battle that has been dominating
Kpop headlines, Kpop fandom clubs and much more. Bernie Choi is an industry
insider president of DFSB Collective, who has been following the skin. The
battle royale between some of the titans of Korea's music, entertainment, and
media industry really boils down to two words, power and control. Now that in
and of itself is fine. But where the problem started to arise was the fact that
although he wanted to unload all of his shares in SM entertainment, he still
insisted on having power and control over SM entertainment as the chief producer
and as the chief creative and essentially as the chief officer. And that was
something that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. And the current management
of SM entertainment in their SM 3.0 mission statement that they released on
YouTube clearly stated they were moving towards a multilabeled, multi producer
business model. But made it clear that Chairman Lee was not to be part of this
new movement going forward. That did not sit well with Chairman Lee and as a
result, he turned around and saw investment from hype. And so you have the
biggest music company in Korea hype going head to head with the biggest tech
company, Kukao, for the power, the control of SM entertainment. And hype, many
from the global audience would know is actually behind the success of BTS, which
is the famous GAPOP group. Could you tell us that what does this mean for a
hype? For many fans and even financial analysts, they may see or know hype as
purely a music company, the home to BTS. But the reality is, is hype is much
more than that. hype is not just only a music company, but they've also emerged
and evolved into a tech company. And so although a lot of observers are looking
at this play for SM entertainment and somehow way being an IP play or a content
play or an artist play, it's actually much more than that. It's really a tech
play as well. And currently, hype is making a very strong play, a market leading
play in both fan community platforms and now in the web three metaverse. And by
virtue of making a majority investment play for SM entertainment, they're no
longer going to be the market leaders in web two web three platforms. They're
going to be the market standard by taking on SM entertainment as part of the
content portfolio. They're looking to consolidate in this K-pop web two web
three space. How are K-pop fans reacting to this take over battle globally? Not
just financial analysts, but more importantly, K-pop fans around the world are
absolutely fixated on the drama that is surrounding this battle for SM
entertainment. It seems to be lighting up Twitter and other social media
platforms as to who's going to win, who should win, who's at fault, who's right.
But I think everybody, whether it be fan or financial analysts, are looking
forward towards March 6th, which is when SM entertainment is scheduled to have
their shareholders meeting. This is probably shaping up to be the biggest Korean
TV drama that's not scripted. Well, that was Bernie Chop, president of DFSB
Collective talking to us earlier, but Karen, what's the K-pop ball? It seems to
have so many fans around the world and it's traveled from South Korea globally.
What's the attraction? I think that it's a distinctive sound, but not too
distinctive. Everything's kind of like the equivalent was stock, stock 8 can
watermen when I was a young person listening to, you know, and that was Rick
Astley and that kind of thing. They had that kind of pop machine, but it's
nothing like this. This kind of industry is now an absolute steroids, but you
know, there's a fabulous Korean aesthetic, you know, it's pleasing to the eye,
it's pleasing to the ear. Are you going to be listening back to this in 2030
years' time? I don't know in the same way that we all kind of go, you know,
never going to give you up. But having said that, the fact that I recognize, so
maybe it's undermining my own argument, but you know, they're pretty big here as
well, not as big as, you know, I would have, not as big as elsewhere because we
have a, a smallish Korean population and we're actually quite insular despite
being part of Southeast Asia. But I can tell you, and I do have to Google this,
like pinkies, touring and sharing, so take that. Look, Bina, have you managed to
change your views? Just a minute, at least after the show, please listen to one,
one kpop song. I mean, I, I heard the news. It's just, I'm not very, very
familiar with all the politics of it. For decades now, a soft rock has been very
popular in America, and this is soft rock with an edge. So it's, it's kind of
very generic in the sense that it appeals to a lot of, I can see how it would
appeal to a lot of people, but as for this wrestling of control, we get this all
the time. You know, no matter what we're talking about, it's still the greatest,
don't want to go to control. That is, well, that's all we have time on, Mr.
Smatter. Thank you for being with us. This is the BBC World Service with no
place like NAMM. On the 29th of March 1973, all American forces will be
