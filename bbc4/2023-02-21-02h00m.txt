 It's 1 o'clock GMT. Hello and Namaste. I'm Dibina Gupta and this is Business
Matters on the BBC World Service. Today we are live in Australia and the US to
talk about business stories shaping your world. As US President Joe Biden visits
Kiev and promises more military and financial aid, we take a look at the cost of
this Russia-Ukraine conflict to America and the world. And would you fancy
paying for a blue badge for your Insta or Facebook account? Tech billionaire
Mark Zuckerberg is betting that you would. But does this mean the end for social
media free business model? We talk about it all on Business Matters here on the
BBC. But first the latest news. I'm Stuart McIntosh with the BBC News. Hello.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a world order based on rules and humanity
depends on how events play out in Ukraine. Speaking after President Biden made
an unannounced visit to Kiev, he said Ukraine's victory over Russia depended on
resolve and he saw such determination in Mr Biden. For his part, Mr Biden said
America would back Ukraine for as long as it took. Nomia Iqbal in Washington has
more on the President's visit. He and his Democratic Party want this to be seen
as a great presidential moment of global leadership and strength. It's a trip
that sends a strong message to Moscow but also to China, which has been accused
of supporting Putin. Mr Biden's words that the United States will stand with
Ukraine for as long as it takes continue to be fully in line with public opinion
here. But there is some resistance among Republican politicians who are
increasingly opposing continued aid to Ukraine. Rescue services in Turkey are
once again searching for people trapped under rubble after a new tremor in the
southeast. It's the same region where 46,000 people were killed two weeks ago by
a much larger earthquake. Laura Bicker is Antakya. A number of mayors from
throughout the province here in Hatay are calling for urgent help. They're
asking for tents. They say more and more people are now needing to be out of any
of the damaged buildings and into tents. Rescuers really feel that this is a
place they no longer want to call home. Tens of thousands of people are thought
to have died here in Hatay province. And I think it's a reminder again tonight
that this is an earthquake zone and one they don't feel safe in. Protesters have
attempted to break through barricades in front of the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset, as MPs debate a controversial judicial reform bill proposed by the far-
right-backed government. The proposed legislation would allow the government
more say over judicial appointments. Tom Bateman is in Jerusalem. The reason
there has been so much debate and passionate argument and protest around all of
this is simply the number of Israelis that believe that the proposed changes by
Israel's new right-wing religious and nationalist government cut to the core of
Israel's identity as a democratic country. They think that the changes will
effectively abolish the checks and balances that the legal system provides
against a government running roughshod and doing whatever it wants without any
oversight from the courts. The army in Bekina Faso now says more than 50
soldiers were killed in an attack by presumed Islamists in the north on Friday.
The military had said earlier eight had died in what it described as intense
fighting in Oudalan province. This is the World News from the BBC. The number of
people killed by flash floods and landslides in south-eastern Brazil has risen
to 40. Rescuers are searching the mud and rubble for survivors after record
rainfall devastated a stretch of coast in Sao Paulo state. President Lula da
Silva visited the worst-hit area around the beach city of São Sebastião to
promise government support for reconstruction. The storms struck as Brazilians
were celebrating carnival. A stroke survivor, partially paralysed on her left
side, has been able to move her hand and arm for the first time in a decade
following spinal cord stimulation. US researchers used new technology to
stimulate Heather Renducli's spinal cord in the neck area, enabling her to fully
open and close her fist, lift and move a can of soup and even cut a piece of
steak. Dr Marco Capogrosso led the study. Our patients recover but they don't
become completely normal. So now they can actually use their arm, even if not
perfectly. That means that they can recover a lot of independence and a lot of
quality of life just because they can use their arm and hand now. The
researchers say the procedure involves implanting a pair of thin metal
electrodes along the neck to engage intact nerve cells. Prosecutors have
downgraded the involuntary manslaughter charges against the Hollywood actor Alec
Baldwin following a fatal shooting with a live gun on a film set in 2021. It
means that Mr Baldwin and the film's armourer will face a maximum 18-month
prison sentence if convicted, rather than a minimum of five years. Botswana says
it's seen a big jump in rhino poaching. The tourism minister, Philida Karang,
told Parliament that 138 rhinos were killed over the past five years, though
numbers dropped sharply last year. Official figures say just two animals were
poached in the five years to 2017. BBC News Hello and Namaste. I'm Deveena Gupta
and you're with Business Matters on the BBC World Service. It's the show where
we connect with two guests from different countries to talk about business
stories that are shaping your world. So thank you for your company at this hour.
It's almost 10005 GMT with me in the gallery are Hannah, Alex, Louise and Salma.
So give us a shout and wherever you are in the world, do drop in a high and tell
us what you would like us to talk about at world.business at bbc.co.uk. You can
also listen to us on podcast, just search for Business Matters wherever you get
your podcast from. And here's what's coming up on the show. It's Metas verified
gamble as the company plans to launch subscription service for Facebook and
Instagram. Is it the end for free for all and all for free business model for
the app? Well, as you think about it, there's another story that we have from
Nigeria. I was scared I was you know, I there was a lot of trepidation coming
with it but I was confident in my skill and I was fortunate with God on my side.
I got a job in my field. Why are so many young professionals leaving Africa's
largest economy? We hear more from these youngsters in a bit. But let's get our
guests in. From Australia we have Karen Percy, senior freelance reporter joining
us from Melbourne. Hi, Karen, how are you? Hello, Divina. Really nice to speak
with you, Karen. Let's get our next guest. We have Peter Morisi economist at the
University of Maryland joining us from the US. Hello, Peter. Hello, nice to be
with you both. Well, nice to be with you both as well. And I'm here joining you
guys from the UK in Salford. And it's also an interesting week, Karen and Peter,
because it would be one week of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. And we would be
talking about this more later in the week. But just as we start this week, I was
thinking about the time what I was doing last year, this time, and I was in
Delhi in India, just going out and doing normal things. And suddenly this news
comes in and which shook us all by surprise. What were you doing, Karen, last
time last year this week? Yeah, I was in Sydney. I was I sit on the board of the
Walkley Foundation, which is an Australian organisation for excellence in
journalism. We were a day out from our big awards. So we were having a board
meeting and I have a great interest in Russia having lived there and have
friends there. And my husband was a correspondent there. So I was sort of
watching in the weeks, months ahead anyway, but still quite shocked. And we did
at our awards ceremony pay tribute to our Ukrainian colleagues in particular,
because, you know, reporting in a war situation is so very, very difficult. So I
do remember hearing during that meeting when the invasion had been announced.
And of course, the life has not been the same for tens of thousands of
Ukrainians who've been facing this aggression. But Peter, what were you doing
last year this time? Well, I was trying to figure out the economic consequences
of an invasion because our president was predicting, our intelligence people
were predicting it was going to happen, that the Russians weren't bluffing. And
so I was busy, you know, I write a weekly column for The Washington Times and
another one for Dow Jones. And I was really trying to figure out what it would
mean in terms of agricultural products, fertilizer, oil, all that kind of
business. And the world has seen a lot of that unfold in the past one year. So
let's start this conversation with what's happened in Kiev today. And this is
where it started. Well, that was the sound that greeted US President Joe Biden
on Monday as he left St. Michael's Cathedral in central Kiev earlier today. He
had visited the place and as the air sirens were sounding, that was how the
situation is in Ukraine right now. Still very much the Russian aggression
continues there. President Biden rode for 10 hours by train from the Polish
border to arrive in Kiev to meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. He was
wearing a blue tie with yellow stripes, which are also colors of the Ukraine
flag as the country sees one year anniversary of the war with Russia this week.
And US President Joe Biden made sure that his message was clear. Earlier this
week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that
are trying to evade sanctions and backfill Russia's war machine. And thanks to
bipartisan support in Congress, this week we're delivering billions in direct
budgetary support. Putin's war of conquest is failing. Russia's military has
lost half its territory at once occupied. Young, talented Russians are fleeing
by the tens of thousands. Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was
divided. As you know, Mr. President, I said to you in the beginning, he's
counting on us not sticking together. And one year later, the evidence is right
here in this room. We stand here together. Well, yes, President Joe Biden has
also promised $500 million in military aid to Ukraine, including artillery,
ammunition, howitzers. And he joins this with nearly $30 billion worth of aid
that the country has already given to Ukraine since February 2022. Earlier, I
spoke with Mark Kansian, a former US colonel who oversaw budgets at the
Pentagon. He's now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies to
talk about what does it mean for Ukraine's economy and what does it mean for
America's economy? Many people focus on advanced weapons, but it's important to
keep in mind that there are no silver bullets in this war. There's no single
weapon that we can give Ukraine that will bring victory. Victory will come from
the cumulative military capability, from weapons and equipment, to training
that's provided to Ukrainians and the morale of the Ukrainian people. What has
been provided is the kind of things that the Ukrainian military needs to
continue its resistance, ammunition, anti-tank weapons. This allows them to keep
going for another couple of weeks. Well, President Biden said that America will
back Ukraine in its fight against Russia for as long as it takes. Now, how long
can the US government realistically send this level of support? We're talking
about billions of dollars, which is also costing America. Well, there's no
question that the war is expensive over the course of a year. It was about $70
billion, including the humanitarian and economic aid. But you have to keep in
mind that the US military budget is about $800 billion, so it's not even 10
percent of the military budget. In theory, the aid could go on forever. Many
people have pointed out that there is some opposition rising, both from the
progressive left and the populist right. So far, they haven't had enough numbers
to change the aid package. What will be important will be Ukraine's ability to
show success on the battlefield. Everyone expects them to launch an offensive
later in the spring. If that offensive is able to gain some territory, I think
that the supporters will be heartened and be willing to continue the aid. If the
offensive fails and it looks like this fighting is going to go on on the same
line month after month, I think that the prospect of a forever war will be very
disturbing. There have been calls from political spectrum about the
accountability as well over where this assistance is going. Yes. So far, there
hasn't been any indication that assistance has been diverted, but that is a
great fear. There's a lot of money, a lot of weapons. The United States has
stood up some oversight efforts, but I think that there'll be a push to increase
those. Nothing would be more damaging to the bipartisan consensus for aid than
to see some of it diverted and some of the weapons going where they shouldn't.
That was Mark Cansey and a former US colonel talking about the aid that's been
promised by the US to Ukraine, but we still have Peter and Karen with us. So
Peter, first up with you, we're talking about billions of dollars of aid, which
has already been given to Ukraine and much more will be needed, as Mark was
pointing out. It also needs diplomacy so that there could be solutions to this
invasion as well. But for now, what you were talking about last year, the impact
of this war on global economy, where do you stand today? Well, it certainly has
had a terrible impact on agricultural prices and on the availability of food,
especially in the third world. I don't know how much longer the Ukraine can
withstand, not its army, but its domestic economy and its people, the kind of
bombardment it's been taking. My feeling is that we give them a great deal of
aid, but it brings the war to a stalemate. The West is afraid that if the
Ukrainians can strike at Russia the way Russia is striking at the Ukraine, for
example, we gave them missiles to hit their depots to frankly assassinate
generals behind the border and so forth, that this would bring about a war in
Europe, a widespread war in Europe. And in some ways, Putin is holding President
Biden and the West hostage. My feeling is that to win the war, we're going to
have to give the Ukrainians a freer hand. We're going to have to give them the
aircraft that they want, the missiles that they need and so forth. The kind of
aid we've given them so far just permits them to hold the Russians at bay
because there's so many of them. You know, there's so many more Russians. Karen,
where do you stand on this? Because obviously there are two school of thoughts
that only military aid will not help. And the second is that there has to be
diplomatic solutions as well. But seeing it from Australia and also from Asia, I
would say for a larger part of the world, this war is Europe's war. Do you see
this as a war in which you do see global stakeholders coming together, taking
sides? I think there's been obviously a degree of coordination and unity and
cohesion on what the response should be. But I think we've also seen that kind
of taper away or break away over the past year. Australia has put in something
in the order of $450 million US dollars between these Bushmaster crafts that
we've sent, howitzers, drones, etc. Some training. We've got some of our
military in Ukraine training officers. But I think that there's definitely a
wavering whether this Biden visit and let's face it, we're going to hear from
Vladimir Putin soon. He's expected to give a speech in the next little while and
you know he's going to be saying something about this. So that might kind of set
the tone as for what is next, because this is clearly a very big signal that the
US is not afraid, that Kiev is safe. So there are so many messages coming out of
Biden's visit. But to Peter's point, agriculture has been affected dramatically,
supply of some foods, availability, etc. The Australian wheat market had a
bumper year last year because of the sanctions against Russia, but also the
problems with Ukraine getting its crop out. One of our biggest companies,
GrainCorp, is having its second biggest year. It'll have a net profit of $140
million. That's despite significant logistical internal issues with floods and
roads and problems within Australia. So it's complicated. We've still got
obviously the issues with oil and gas. Australia is now selling more gas to
Europe, but that's putting pressure on prices and Australian politicians are
trying to ensure that that doesn't happen here. And of course, across the
region, as Asia Pacific, you've got demands on fertilizer and the inputs for the
food they eat. So it's quite complicated. And I guess I'm watching for what
Vladimir Putin is going to say as to where this goes and how much longer this
goes on. But I don't imagine diplomacy is going to work. But I also feel that an
escalation of military activity isn't helpful either. So it's really a difficult
one. And of course, sanctions have been part of a way of putting pressure on
Russia as well. Today, US President Joe Biden said there would be more sanctions
against the country, but he stopped short of telling and spelling them out for
now. Earlier last week, the European Union said that they would be putting the
10th round of sanctions in place against Russia. And Peter, how far do these
economic sanctions then work? Because Russia's official figures for economy were
released today, and it seems that the Russian economy has contracted by 2.2%
versus last year. And this actually is not that bad compared to what analysts
had projected just this time last year, when things had started to unravel, that
if the West steps in, if there are more sanctions, Russia's economy would
cripple. Well, the basic problem is that the sanctions may affect Russia in the
long run because of brain drain and people leaving and so forth. But in the near
term, Putin has managed to get his economy organized on a wartime basis. That is
really not all that bad in the sense that he's not going to get a backlash at
home. I mean, let's face it, 2% of GDP, Britain's suffering worse than that
because of Brexit. The West seems to think that sanctions are the bullet that
will make the difference, and they won't. The war has to be won on the
battlefield. And I think that we've become too enamored with the notion that
sanctions will solve the problem. The only way to defeat the Russian army is to
defeat the Russian army. Wars are fought in the present tense, and in the
present tense, the Russians can do what's necessary. Here's the bigger question
also, Karen, because you have China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, who would be
reportedly meeting President Vladimir Putin this week. So it talks about China's
now direct involvement, has stayed away, but it has not condemned Russia
directly till now. But this is the first time that you have Chinese official
meeting Vladimir Putin since the start of invasion from last year. And that goes
on to say that there are higher stakes. Absolutely. And that's a very clear
message that's being sent by China as well. And everybody's nervous about China
on lots and lots of levels. But again, I think we need to, I guess, see what
happens. Sure, the sanctions in reality for those who've been targeted by them
are an irritation. They're an annoyance for oligarchs. And I think Peter's
absolutely right. Russians in the main, their lives have been affected. But the
one constant in Russia has been changed. They are adaptive, they are resilient.
They'll just kind of go, OK, I can't get that in the supermarket. I'll just do
something else. So I do think that, like I say, I'm going to be watching what
Vladimir Putin says more so than the external factors. I think China coming in
is very, very important. And there'll be lots of people who'll be able to read
the tea leaves on that. But I think this immediate, it's not a provocation
exactly, but it's not designed to calm the waters either with Biden in Kiev. So
I think the next little while will tell us more than perhaps this China meeting.
Well, this continues to be a top story. Well, Peter, I have to say this
continues to be a top story on BBC.com. And you can read more about that because
I want to get into our next conversation. Just change the gear a little bit here
and talk about social media giant Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram and
has unveiled its latest feature for users. And it looks remarkably familiar. The
new subscription service called Meta Verified allows users to pay between 12 and
15 dollars a month to have a blue tick next to their name. A lot of people are
calling it a badge as well. And it echoes sort of the rollout, which is similar
scheme to Twitter shortly after must take over as well. So I want to actually
get your thoughts on this, Peter, because Blue Badge, how would you want to pay
for something like this on Facebook and Instagram? I think that organizations
will pay for it. For example, if you work for a newspaper, the newspaper will
pay for it because the idea of verifying who you are is important and that it'll
provide that service. But for the vast majority of users, this is going to be a
nuisance. Simply already, Facebook is prioritizing posters that it promotes,
that paid to be promoted and so forth above your followers. And I run into that
in Twitter. You know, I mean, I log on to Twitter and I get a bunch of promoted
posts as opposed to the people I'm following. What this tends to do is to
discourage usage. So while they might gain on the one hand through through
subscriptions, they're going to lose on the other through advertising potency
because people will log on less. You know, this this idea that they always have
to constantly grow. These are six. Facebook's a successful business, but it
can't grow indefinitely. It's kind of reached its limits. Twitter's not
successful. Loses money and probably will go out of existence at some point.
Well, Instagram, and it's doing pretty well if you look at the reels and the
short videos, of course, Meta overall is trying to get that lost revenue back
from ad spending. But, Karen, in your view, because this service has been rolled
out in Australia and New Zealand for now, are there many takers for these kind
of paid subscription badges, which also promise some exclusive stickers, some
more access for the story and reels? Not that I'm seeing, and that's just
anecdotal. And look, you know, I think to Peter's point about news
organisations, well, a lot of our news organisations have actually really pulled
back from social media more generally, just because it's it's so hard to
predict. Once upon a time, you could actually rely on the data that came out of
the clicks and the links, etc. And that's not so much the case. I think one
thing that's also really worth noting in the Australian context is that for
decades, Australians resisted the idea of cable television. We had a very
thriving free to air so-called network where you didn't have to pay for it or
you did through your taxes or your, you know, the advertising costs for the
goods that you bought. So Australians have been pretty slow to adapt to that.
But now they're very big on streaming. But they're also every Australian I know
is juggling their streaming services. They'll go to Apple at one stage when they
know there's something they want offered. They'll shut that down for a bit. So
they're actually managing this. Twelve dollars on the web and fifteen dollars on
your phone. I don't know how you differentiate because I constantly go between
the two all the time. I mean, that was the question that struck me as well. Huge
amount of money. Why would you have... Yeah. Why are the mobile prices higher
than the web? I mean, I couldn't figure that out as well. Peter, do you have any
thoughts on that? You know, I really don't know why that would be. Other than
the fact that with the mobiles, they have to pay the store some money. And so
they're basically saying that if you do it through iPhone, we're going to make
you pay the fee that part of the fee that iPhone is charging us. That's the only
thing I can figure. When you sign up on your computer, they don't have the
middleman. True. But Karen, who are the people... I would also add that a couple
of years ago. Yeah. Go for it. So Australians remember a couple of years ago
when our government was talking about this mandatory bargaining code, making
Google and Facebook in particular pay for news content because they've taken
away so much advertising revenue from our traditional media organisations.
Facebook shut down news sites and the fallout of that was in fact health
services, local community groups also got shut down. So Australians kind of had
this idea of Facebook that it's a bit of a bully and a threat. And I'm seeing a
drop in functionality and I'm seeing a drop in certainly engagement. And I agree
with Peter, I'm seeing on both Twitter and Facebook much more promoted stuff.
And the stuff that's promoted on Twitter once upon a time was at least I would
have called it quality advertiser. Now it feels like it's almost, you know,
fungal toe cream and some of the other stuff you used to see on late night TV.
There's a difference age group. There's a difference of age group as well. The
demograph of FB and Instagram and Twitter, they're all different age groups,
aren't they? I think that's very true. But I'm sorry, Peter, you should, I've
been dominating. You should come on in on this one. We have 10 seconds each for
both of you. But go for it, Peter and then Karen. Facebook is for older people.
OK, Karen, older people, Facebook and younger Insta. Is that how the dialogue
is? That's right, except that Instagram and chasing young people and predicting
them is a mugs game. They change their mind as soon as they're somewhere. So I'd
be very mindful of predicting too much on young people. All right, but we can
predict one thing. Please do come back after this break and see you on the other
side. This is the BBC World Service with the first of two winning plays from the
International Radio Playwriting Competition. My play is an epic Antarctic man on
a mission tale that takes us to a place we could not expect. Snow flurries have
the grace of fairies. Small fairies become larger fairies. Dreaming with eyes
wide open is watching them today. Summer here, lest we forget, wrapped up in fur
so thick at a distance we look not like men but... Halt! Halt! What do we look
like? Halt! Ogres? Strange fur covered snowmen? With that I can hear it again.
The Snowman at bbcworldservice.com You're listening to Business Matters from the
BBC World Service with me, Devina Gupta. Coming up in the next half hour, from
Nigeria, why are so many young professionals leaving Africa's largest economy?
And it's not music to the ears for all the K-pop fans as there's a messy
corporate battle for control all about it after the latest world news. BBC News
with Stuart Macintosh. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a world order based
on rules and humanity depends on the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine. After
President Biden's highly symbolic trip to Kiev, he said he'd seen Mr Biden's
determination to maintain US support in the fight against Russia. Rescue
services in Turkey are once again searching for people trapped under rubble by a
new tremor in the south-east near the border with Syria. This is the same region
where 46,000 people were killed two weeks ago by a much larger earthquake. Three
people have died and 200 were injured. Brazil's parliament has voted to continue
a highly controversial overhaul of the judicial system proposed by Benjamin
Netanyahu's religious nationalist government. The opposition has vowed to fight
against it after the bill was approved in a first reading. The number of people
killed by flash floods and landslides in south-eastern Brazil has risen to 40.
Record rainfall has devastated a stretch of the coast in Sao Paulo state.
There's been an outcry in Colombia after a former member of the National Truth
Commission went into hiding after receiving death threats. Lena Palacios played
a leading role in the Commission's report on atrocities committed during the
long internal conflict. Two top Spanish transport officials have resigned over a
botched order for new commuter trains. They proved to be too wide to fit through
non-standard tunnels in the mountainous regions of Asturias and Cantabria. US
prosecutors have downgraded the involuntary manslaughter charges against the
Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin following a fatal shooting on a film set in 2021.
Mr Baldwin and the film's armourer face a maximum of 18 months in prison if
convicted. And Botswana says it's in a big jump in rhino poaching, with 138
rhinos killed over the past five years. BBC News Hello and Namaste, you're with
Business Matters, I'm Devina Gupta. It's a show where we connect with two guests
from different countries to talk about business stories that are shaping your
world. And today we have guests from Australia and the US. And we will be
talking about why are Nigeria's young skilled workers leaving the country? Also
we'll be talking about this. It's one of the biggest corporate battles in the
Korean entertainment industry. We get to the details in a bit. We have Peter
Morisi, economist at the University of Maryland joining us from the US and Karen
Percy, senior freelance reporter joining us from Melbourne. And we played this
clip just a while ago, guys. But Peter and Karen, could you identify the songs
there? One was Gangnam Style with Psy. Yes, yes. The other one I don't know.
It's too recent for me. I don't know about you, Peter. No, I really can't help
you on that. I'm not into that. We guys had a bet internally here in the studio
that, you know, how many of these, both the songs, I mean, if you'll be able to
identify both the songs. I'm really happy. How often can you understand the
words in these pop songs as they go by? This is exactly the demographics we were
talking about earlier on the show, Peter. So the younger crowd. But anyways, we
get to that story in a bit. First up, from Africa's largest economy, Nigeria.
Now it's going to elections in just a couple of days. And one of the major
issues that's affecting the country in recent times is the mass exodus of young
professionals who are now relocating abroad. And this is causing a severe brain
drain and giving employers a nightmare. BBC's Bisi Adebayo asked some of those
who have left the country why they took that step. And here's what she found.
Nigeria, home to over 200 million people with a young population of over 70
percent, a country regarded as Africa's most populous nation. At first glance,
Nigeria has a lot going for it. Talk about a vibrant tech scene, a booming
entertainment sector, a fashion and creative hub in Africa with a GDP of over
400 billion dollars. But despite that, millions of people are suffering from
alien infrastructure, inequality and poverty and a high unemployment rate of
more than 30 percent. This has forced many young professionals out of the
country as they seek better quality of life. They are primarily skilled youth,
including doctors, nurses, IT engineers, university lecturers and technicians
and also journalists like Victoria. She admits it wasn't easy to leave Lagos for
Regina in southern Canada, but she feels she didn't have a choice. I was
worried. I was scared. I was you know, there was a lot of trepidation coming
with it, but I was confident in my skill and I was fortunate with God on my
side. I got a job in my field. Exact figures of Nigerians leaving the country is
hard to come by, but data from the United Nations shows in 2020 there were 1.7
million international migrants from the country. And that's nearly double the
number from a decade earlier. Addition, yes. Subtraction. One person who's
getting ready to pack her bags for the UK is Ola, a schoolteacher in Lagos.
Teaching is just something easy for me. I can work with children. It's fun
working with them really. But because of the remuneration aspect of it,
something good is not really coming out of it. You don't get paid well. You
don't really get all the benefits you're supposed to get. So why should I
continue doing it? I want to do something new, something that could change my
status and make things better for me. Now, that's the view of some workers. What
about how this is affecting employers? A question I asked the director general
of the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, Wally Smart. When you have
the talent, those you call talent, leaving your business in droves, it
compromises your ability to be competitive. It changes dynamics for an average
business because those that can or that could enhance your competitiveness, they
are leaving in droves, leaving you exposed and leaving you at the mercy of so
many dynamics that are not within your control. He also told me his last three
members of staff in seven months and that the brain drain is causing a real
challenge for recruiters when it comes to finding the right person for the job.
The conversation about are employable are those that are left are employable are
there, that context will come up. And for those that we have termed
unemployable, you know, I also ask how well has the educational system and the
curriculum, how well has it prepared them to be competitive or to be employable?
So it's a mass of issues that underlines the issue of people migrating out of
the country. This is just a snapshot of the issues affecting the jobs market in
Nigeria. But what would it take to persuade those who have already left the
country like Victoria or change the mind of people like Oleh who are getting set
to leave? I don't know if a change in leadership will be sufficient. There has
to be some drastic change in the whole of Nigeria for me to want to go back. I
want the economic situation of the nation to be well ordered, to be, and also
the unrest that is everywhere, that's political unrest, things have to be done
about that. With the elections coming up in a few days, this is one of the big
issues those who come to power will have to deal with. And it's one people like
Victoria, Oleh and Wale and so many Nigerians in a similar situation will be
keeping a close eye on. That was the BBC's Bisi Adebayo, who was talking about
the brain drain that's happening from Nigeria. And it is a global theme as well,
because Peter, in the US, it is a high level country and high income country.
You have people coming from all over the world. And I was going through the data
of students who actually come to the US and eventually settle there. India and
China are among two top countries that attract talent, where talent is coming
from in the US. Right. We're getting talent from all over the world because they
come to my classroom was full of them. And that was great. They were wonderful
students. But Nigerians I have particular experience with. We have a lot of
Nigerians here in Washington. And once they come, they may go home to visit. But
the economic opportunities here are so much greater. For example, as you folks
know, I do a lot of Fox TV and the driver they sent for me over these last 10
years is often a Nigerian. He's a very lovely gentleman. And he just makes
enough money here that he can go home by a by a house and what have you. And he
goes there on vacations and whatnot. The economic opportunities here are much
greater. Now, I've also met others that have mid-level skills, not people that
come to be students here, but people that are educated in Nigeria. And for them,
often the skills are not as transferable, for example, if you're a financial
analyst or what have you, because the credentials don't move so easily. The
people that are most adaptable, it seems, are the lower skilled workers and
those that come here as students. Once they come, the opportunities here are
just too much to bring them back. But do these skills also translate into
inclusive opportunities? Inclusive opportunities? Yeah, I think so. Washington
is a very multicultural place, whether we're talking about gender or we're
talking about race or ethnicity. There's a lot of opportunity in this region for
people. This is a very progressive area. And I don't mean that in terms of
Democrats versus Republicans. I'm a conservative Republican. And no, I think
there is a lot of opportunity in that regard. And Karen, obviously, high income
countries attract more immigrants, especially from countries with younger
population. And when you see those skilled labour coming to Australia, does it
also put pressure on resources within the country? That's been one of the
biggest debates. Yeah, there's a lot of noise around that, you know, that it
drives up house prices, that suddenly you can't drive on the highway and that
there's no seats on the bus. But I've actually seen quite a bit of evidence,
research saying that that's not so much the case. Certainly, there can be
pressures on infrastructure, but that's usually because governments have failed
to actually follow through on their promises to build new train stations or
widen roads or to actually build housing. We have a real issue here in Australia
with Scott. We have some of the highest house prices on the planet relative to
earnings because of dysfunctional processes throughout our whole system, land
release, corrupt processes, etc. But there are real issues, I think, certainly
in the Asia-Pacific region. One of the most evident populations you see across
working outside of their country are the Filipinos. There are 250,000 Filipinos
working in Australia. We see them in our health system, in our aged care and
other caring sectors. You know, the Philippines has anywhere from 10 million
plus people every year working overseas, sending in remittances. The Philippines
economy would probably collapse without it. But we are really needing to be very
mindful of, yes, in Australia we talk a lot about skilled migrants, but there is
an impact that happens to those countries where it's coming from. We only have a
very small Nigerian population here and small African diaspora more generally,
something in the order of 20,000 Nigerians. But let's also think about Russia
and Ukraine. Millions have left Russia in the past year. They're middle class,
they're skilled, opposing Putin's war. Millions displaced in Ukraine who would
love to go home but aren't going to be in a position necessarily to do so for
quite some time. So that kind of problem comes from a lot of factors. But
picking up on the youth issue in Nigeria, I mean, when you look at the age of
some of those election candidates, and there's not a lot for young people. So I
think that there are systemic issues, there are blatant political issues
involved, but we do as citizens of countries that benefit from the skills of
others need to be mindful of the impact it's having globally, I think. Well,
yes, go ahead, Peter. The other thing to remember is that Nigeria is an oil
economy. Their oil production is down considerably in recent years. But the
problem with oil economies is they don't create a lot of diversity in terms of
opportunity. If you can connect it to the oil sector, it's great. Why is it that
my driver can't earn the kind of money in Nigeria that he does here? Now, part
of it is level of development, but part of it also is that oil money does not
tend to spread the way, say, technology money does. And that's very unfortunate.
You become captive of oil. We call it the curse of oil in America, well, among
economists. But if you look at the Middle East countries as well, the
petrodollars is what's called there, the way which has fuel development. So of
course, it goes a lot deeper into that. But I get the point which you were
making, Karen, earlier as well about younger Nigerians, because 84 percent of
them are under the age of 34. And that's where the elections, which will be
around the corner now, which are around the corner now, will determine the
government that they choose, which can lead to those opportunities back home
that Peter has been talking about. But looking at Sydney now, and this is a
story that you actually shared with us, Karen, about Sydney hosting World Pride
202, the biggest LGBTQ plus event in the world, and with more than 300 worldwide
discos and exhibits, films and rallies. And let's take our audience to the
place. I think that when people come to Oxford Street, they're walking into a
history of like drag and queerness that has been established for many, many
years and has a very unique Australian voice. And I'm excited to people
experience that and also the fabulous indigenous culture that we have. This is
great, not just for the people who are involved, but it's great for everyone in
the community because it's going to support those little businesses. It's going
to support the nighttime economy. It's going to bring people back to this iconic
and amazing part of Sydney. There is no doubt that this is a rainbow shot in the
arm for the tourism industry. We could not be more thrilled. All right. Rainbow
shot in the arm. Well, this year marks the 45th anniversary of the first gay and
lesbian Mardi Gras parade and the fifth year of Australian marriage equality in
the country. So Karen, you've actually been there as well and taken part in
celebrations and you're planning to go again. So I'm truly jealous. But tell us
about the business of it and the fact that it's become so big now. It has. Yes,
I was there at the weekend. I had other business, I was there and some friends
and I went out to a really fabulous live play, a kind of campy take on
gentlemen's preferred blondes. It was really fabulous and a really small
theater. And you know, it was, you know, Sydney was awash with rainbow and we
were near Oxford Street where one of your earlier contributors talked about. But
this is a very big event. The Mardi Gras parade itself has always been a great
tourist attraction for Sydney, particularly in recent years. It's televised. You
know, it's somewhat family friendly, despite the fact that it can be quite
risque at times. But World Pride has kind of upped the ante. Like you say,
hundreds of events. This is expected to have in the order of seventy five
million dollars in economic activity, 80,000 people coming into the city and
then hundreds of thousands of locals also. And there's a real sense that, you
know, now Australian, it's mainstream, the LGBTIQAI plus community, you know,
it's now much more mainstream than it was. But some of those who go back to that
first, those first years, they call them the 1978s. And that was a real protest
movement. It was actually, you know, a protest to actually exist in the lives
that they wanted to live. You know, it started with 500 protesters in the heart
of Sydney. There was considerable police backlash, in fact, violence. A lot of
those protesters ended up in prison. So there's a real question now about how
commercialized it becomes, that there is still a protest. There's still great
discrimination for those communities. But is there a significant pink economy as
well? I mean, the concept is from the 60s in the US, where it was seen that the
LGBTQ plus community had more purchasing power. That's where the terminology
pink economy. Is it a large pink economy in Australia? I think it has been, but
I think now that, you know, same sex marriage has been legislated, I think, you
know, you can't actually assume that every LGBTIQA plus person is rich. I think
it used to be easier for rich people to, you know, live the lives that they
live. But I don't I think it's hard to assume that everybody in those
communities is rich. And I think there's a lot of evidence in Australia to prove
that that's not that's not to say there isn't this economy, because there are
events, there are services, there are all manner of things that are catering to
these communities. You know, there's a real concern, though, about rain, rainbow
washing, if you like, that some of the communities that have been the most
discriminating and the most harsh on these communities, the police, some
political parties, some particular politicians, even some corporates are now
kind of, you know, putting their flag up their rainbow colored flag. In fact,
they really haven't done, you know, these communities. Have you seen this Peter
as well? Rainbow washing, the act of using rainbow colors on everything that you
would like to advertise, apparel, accessories, landmarks? We have them all over
the place. But we also don't have rainbow flags where things actually happen.
For example, I was on the vestry of St. John's Church in Georgetown when we
hired a gay rector, which is the head pastor for people that don't aren't
Anglicans or Episcopalians. And they're pretty well represented. The reason why
the pink economy has so much purchasing power is because they've done so well in
the economy. Now, what has changed is in the old days, we knew who they were,
but they had to be very discreet. They were in the closet, so to speak. But you
knew who your friends were that were gay. Now you can be openly gay. And now
it's not that way every place in the country, but it's that way in enough places
in the country and in the places that matter. New York, Washington, Chicago, Los
Angeles, where there's money and opportunity that they tend to gravitate towards
those locations. So you know, in Washington, we probably have a higher
concentration of gays and lesbians and so forth than we would say in Utah. But
there are a lot of opportunities here. And you know, I've been connected with
with folks from that community for about 35 years now. Well, estimates, global
estimate is it's about four trillion dollar is the is what pink economy
generates each year globally. And it's quite a bit of money, in fact. So well, I
hope you have a great time, Karen, when you go this weekend as well and enjoy
the glamour, the love. And we need more of that in the world, isn't it? Well,
alas, I won't get to Sydney this weekend. I might catch it in a couple of weeks.
But this is the first year a sitting prime minister will attend and walk in the
Mardi Gras parade. That's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. So there's been huge
evolution. But there are certainly people who think the revolution is not over
yet. Well, on that note, let me take us take us through another revolution. And
that one you were about to guess as well, Peter. But I think it was the cold
that got in the way you would have got the gangnam style. But let's talk about
whether you're a fan of K-pop or not. You will probably recognize some of these
songs. All right, we're talking about the Korean pop songs that have
revolutionized the entertainment industry globally. But now this industry is
seeing one of the hottest corporate takeover battle of the year. SM
Entertainment is one of the largest South Korean entertainment companies, which
has launched many K-pop stars. And HYBE is known for the popular BTS group from
South Korea. And now HYBE wants to acquire majority shares in SM Entertainment.
They have the support of the company's founder. But this move is being resisted
by other shareholders in the company, including the management, which wants to
go with another suitor. And this is a complex battle that has been dominating
K-pop headlines, K-pop fandom clubs and much more. Bernie Cho is an industry
insider, president of DFSB Collective, who has been following this keenly. The
battle royale between some of the titans of Korea's music, entertainment and
media industry really boils down to two words, power and control. Now that in
and of itself is fine. But where the problem started to arise was the fact that
although he wanted to unload all of his shares in SM Entertainment, he still
insisted on having power and control over SM Entertainment as the chief producer
and as the chief creative and essentially as the chief officer. And that was
something that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. And the current management
of SM Entertainment in their SM 3.0 mission statement that they released on
YouTube clearly stated they were moving towards a multi-label, multi-producer
business model, but made it clear that Chairman Lee was not to be part of this
new movement going forward. That did not sit well with Chairman Lee. And as a
result, he turned around and sought investment from HYBE. And so you have the
biggest music company in Korea, HYBE, going head to head with the biggest tech
company, Kakao, for the power, the control of SM Entertainment. And HYBE, many
from the global audience would know, is actually behind the success of BTS,
which is the famous K-pop group. Could you tell us that what does this mean for
HYBE? For many fans and even financial analysts, they may see or know HYBE as
purely a music company, the home to BTS. But the reality is, is HYBE is much
more than that. HYBE is not just only a music company, but they've also emerged
and evolved into a tech company. And so although a lot of observers are looking
at this play for SM Entertainment and somehow way being an IP play or a content
play or an artist play, it's actually much more than that. It's really a tech
play as well. And currently HYBE is making a very strong play, a market-leading
play in both fan community platforms and now in the Web3 metaverse. And by
virtue of making a majority investment play for SM Entertainment, they're no
longer going to be the market leaders in Web2, Web3 platforms. They're going to
be the market standard by taking on SM Entertainment as part of the content
portfolio they're looking to consolidate in this K-pop Web2, Web3 space. How are
K-pop fans reacting to this takeover battle globally? Not just financial
analysts, but more importantly, K-pop fans around the world are absolutely
fixated on the drama that is surrounding this battle for SM Entertainment. It
seems to be lighting up Twitter and other social media platforms as to who's
going to win, who should win, who's at fault, who's right. But I think
everybody, whether it be fan or financial analysts, are looking forward towards
March 6th, which is when SM Entertainment is scheduled to have their
shareholders meeting. This is probably shaping up to be the biggest Korean TV
drama that's not scripted. Well, that was Bernie Cho, president of DFSB
Collective, talking to us earlier. But Garen, what's the K-pop bull? It seems to
have so many fans around the world and it's traveled from South Korea globally.
What's the attraction? I think that, you know, it's a distinctive sound, but not
too distinctive. Everything's kind of like the equivalent was Stock Aitken-
Waterman when I was a young person listening to, you know, and that was Rick
Astley and that kind of thing. I had that kind of pop machine, but it's nothing
like this. This kind of industry is now on absolute steroids. But you know,
there's a fabulous Korean aesthetic, you know, it's pleasing to the eye, it's
pleasing to the ear. Are you going to be listening back to this in 20, 30 years
time? I don't know, in the same way that we all kind of go, you know, never
going to give you up. But having said that, the fact that I recognize Psy maybe
is undermining my own argument, you know, they're pretty big here as well, but
not as big as, you know, I would have not as big as elsewhere because we have a
small-ish Korean population and we're actually quite insular despite being part
of Southeast Asia. But I can tell you, and I did have to Google this, Blackpink
is touring in June. So take that, Peter. Well, Peter, have you have you managed
to change your views just a bit, at least after the show, please listen to one,
one K-pop song. I mean, I heard the music. It's just I'm not very, very familiar
with all the politics of it. For decades now, Soft Rock has been very popular in
America. And this is Soft Rock with an edge. So it's kind of very generic in the
sense that it appeals to a lot. I can see how it would appeal to a lot of
people. But as for this wrestling of control, we get this all the time. You
know, no matter what we're talking about, it seems that the creators don't want
to let go of control, even when they sell out for the money. Well, that's all we
have time on Business Matters. Thank you for being with us. Thank you.
