 at 8. After the news, the briefing room. BBC News at 8 o'clock. Police in
Northern Ireland are questioning three men in connection with the attempted
murder of an off-duty police officer. Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell
was shot outside a sports complex in Omer in County Tyrone. He remains in a
critical condition in hospital. The dissident Republican group, the New IRA, is
the main focus of the police investigation. The former First Minister Dame
Arlene Foster witnessed the attempted murder of her father in an IRA ambush in
1979. It is a throwback to days that we all thought had gone and to hear the
details of what happened and the fact that not only John's son but many other
young people were around when this happened is really really awful to think
about. It's the lowest of the low. Labour has accused the government of breaking
the immigration system after official figures showed that 166,000 asylum seekers
are waiting for a decision on their case. Of those, a hundred and ten thousand
have been waiting more than six months. Greg Hands, the Conservative Party
chairman, says ministers have a laser like focus on finding solutions. New
official figures show the number of students in England regularly missing school
is double the rate before the pandemic. A government report says around 25% of
pupils missed at least 10% of classes in the last term. That's compared with 13%
for the same period in 2019. In the past hour, the disgraced Hollywood film
producer Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 16 years in prison by a judge in
Los Angeles. He was convicted of rape and sexual assault after a trial last
year. Mr. Weinstein told the court the allegations were a set-up. The sentence
will run at the same time as a 23-year term he was already serving. The Football
Association says John Motsen's voice will always be synonymous with football
following his death at the age of 77. The commentator covered ten World Cups and
29 FA Cup finals during his 50 year career with the BBC. BBC News. Nearly a year
on, how can peace be restored in Europe? This will end when there is enough
progress on the battlefield by Ukraine. A war that has to be won or a broken
peace. This is James Naughty and in Europe and the United States I've been
talking to negotiators about the lessons from the past. You've had a 70-year
armistice in Korea but what you've not had is 70 years of a quiet calm border.
Every war is different so how might understanding old conflict help Ukraine
where both sides speak of nothing but victory? How wars end on BBC Radio 4
available now on BBC Sounds. As we heard in front row earlier artificial
intelligence now has the ability to write magazine articles not to mention
novels songs and works of art. So how should businesses respond to the evolution
of AI? Evan Davis and guests discuss its potential for creating new products and
increasing efficiency in the bottom line in half an hour. That's after this
week's edition of the Briefing Room with David Aronovich. The Russian invasion
of Ukraine is a year old and the brutal war has spawned two innovations. The
mass use of small munition carrying drones and the mass deployment in a
conventional conflict of a private army the Wagner Group. So what is the Wagner
Group and what do we know about its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and could Wagner be
as much of a threat as an asset to Vladimir Putin? Step into the Briefing Room
and together we'll find out. As we often do on the Briefing Room let's start
with some history. How and why was the Wagner Group created? Andres Ratz is
Senior Research Fellow of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.
Andres Ratz, when did Russia start using private military companies? The first
time Russia created something resembling to a private military company was in
2013. That formation called Slavonic Corps was put in action in Syria but due to
the lack of experience, due to the lack of elaborated operational standards, it
blatantly failed. It failed because the cooperation mechanisms with the Syrian
army were not yet established. There was not proper intelligence provided, there
was no proper weaponry provided. So after one skirmish with Syrian resistance
fighters, the Russian private military company Slavonic Corps was defeated and
the survivors were actually taken back to Russia. And Russia thereafter learned
a lot from this mistake and thereafter a year later, around 2014, they
established the so-called Wagner Group. We imagine that Wagner and private
armies is something of a uniquely Russian phenomenon but is that really true?
Before setting up the Wagner Group, Russia actively studied how the West has
used private military companies in Afghanistan, in Iraq and in other places. For
example, Wagner learned a lot from how the US relied on the private military
company Blackwater during the operation in Iraq and the Russians also studied
the tasks and operations of several other private military companies as well.
They set up first the Slavonic Corps and thereafter the Wagner Group based on
the lessons they learned from Western private military companies. However,
Wagner has a number of very particular characteristics which is not present in
other Western private military companies. The most important one is that Wagner
is extremely closely integrated with Russia's military, particularly with the
military intelligence. It looks like that Wagner is more a proxy force of
Russia's military intelligence than a real private company. To give you one
example, Wagner is using a joint facility with Russia's military intelligence in
Molkino in southern Russia. I couldn't name a single other private military
company which shares any facility with a given country's military intelligence.
Second, Wagner is actively relying on supplies, logistics, intelligence,
operational planning on Russia's regular military. So Wagner is not self-
reliant. Wagner is not independent. Wagner functions basically as an arm of
Russia's regular military. Third, while conventional private military companies
are indeed able to conduct high intensity operations, this is not their main
profile. However, Wagner's main profile is high intensity operations. Fourth,
Western private security company works for a wide range of clients. Wagner does
not have a single such client that would be independent from the Russian state.
When we go back to Wagner's origins, was it partially based on the Russians
looking at private military contractors being used by other countries and
thinking, we'll do that? And then it significantly developed a different
approach. Indeed, while the West, the use of private military companies has been
dominantly motivated by the intention to spare some money for Russia, the most
important motivation was ambiguity, to project state power in a covert way. Is
Wagner the only private military company currently engaged by Russia? Has it now
got a monopoly, if you like, on the private military company industry?
Definitely not, but Wagner is definitely the biggest one. However, there is an
important particularity here. According to Russian law, private military
companies are illegal. So Wagner is not registered in Russia as a private
military company. Wagner didn't even exist until very recently as a single
entity. Instead, Wagner is a composition of thousands, if not hundreds of shell
companies. So Wagner is not a single entity. Wagner is more an intellectual
construct and the brand or an umbrella under which there are several smaller
organisations. We've heard in the news that Wagner has also been operating in
other continents, including Africa. And the question that you immediately ask
yourself is how can one company be active in so many places? Is the answer to
that the one you've just suggested, which is that actually it's incredibly
diverse? Yes, it's very diverse. And it's also fairly large. Before the February
2022 escalation in Ukraine, Wagner had around 6 to 10,000 operatives. And
several operations it conducted in Africa were, in terms of size, relatively
small, deploying a few dozens of people deploying a few hundred people. So
Wagner was able to maintain and run more than a dozen operations in Africa and
in other countries at the same time. Wagner also made an action in South
America, in Venezuela. It was actually the Wagner Group, which saved the
president of Venezuela, Maduro, from being removed by the democratic opposition.
What was the Russian interest behind that? Russian state oil company Rosneft had
more than $12 billion investment in Venezuela. And Moscow was afraid that should
the democratic opposition win, this investment would have been endangered. What
would a typical Wagner operation in Africa look like? And who would actually be
paying for it? Wagner is able to operate only in such places where the state
power is weak. Wagner is offering a wide range of services, ranging from just
training local soldiers to guarding facilities, providing VIP protection, or in
some cases, doing the actual fighting. In unstable regions, tend to be short of
cash. So in many cases, Wagner operatives get paid in kind in natural resources.
For example, in Syria, Wagner's work in liberating oil fields was paid in
concessions on that given oil field. There were cases when Wagner was offered a
25% share in each and every oil well they liberated. In some African countries,
the concessions are in mining concessions or diamond trade related concessions.
In terms of international law, is what Wagner does in these countries, is it
legal? The legality of the operations of private military companies often tends
to be a somewhat shaky or somewhat ambiguous ground. It's not always easy to
define what exactly is legal, but there are many cases when the operations of
Wagner have been documented being outright illegal and violating international
humanitarian law. There have been cases when Wagner operatives committed crimes
against humanity, committed actual war crimes. So if I would need to give a
binary answer, whether it's legal or not, my answer would be that in most cases,
it's more illegal than not. Andrus Rats with the origins and scope of the Wagner
Group. We'll spend the rest of the programme now looking at the group's role in
the war in Ukraine and the implications for the Russian leadership of having
such a force recruited by and operating under the command of a private
individual, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Joining me now are Marina Myron, postdoctoral
researcher at the Department of War Studies at King's College London. Samantha
de Benden, Associate Fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs,
Chatham House. And Joanna Dadeish-Pereira, Senior Research Fellow at the Royal
United Services Institute, Europe, based in Brussels. Samantha de Benden, let's
talk a bit more about Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Who is he? Well, he's
an absolutely fascinating character. And I think one day Hollywood will pay
millions to do a Netflix series about his life. It really is out of a movie. He
was born into a modest family in St. Petersburg. And St. Petersburg is important
because that is also Vladimir Putin's town. He was a petty criminal, he's
actually been in prison for armed robbery. And when he came out of prison, which
was just about the same time the Soviet Union was collapsing and private
property and private enterprises allowed, he became a hot dog seller. And he
really began to make a fortune that way. Now, he's a very famous figure. But the
way St. Petersburg was in the early 90s, you could not make a fortune unless you
were involved with organized crime. And also, you had to have some kind of link
with the Leningrad and St. Petersburg government, which Vladimir Putin was part
of. And it looks as though his links with Putin really cemented in the early
2000s. But he'd known him for a while, since the whole murky world of government
mixed up together. And Pugoshin really made his really big fortune as a caterer
to the armed forces and to Russian schools. These are, of course, state
contracts. So, you know, the whole concept of a private businessman, who made
most of his money on government contracts, again, showed the interlinking
between government business and crime in Russia, which is why he epitomizes, in
a way, everything that is wrong with the Russian system and the way capitalism
developed in Russia. Samantha, I first came across him when there were those
revelations about these troll factories in Russia, which were pushing out fake
news and propaganda around about the time of the American presidential election
in 2016. What was Pugoshin's role in all that? Well, he claims that he founded
them. Again, these are Pugoshin's claims. I don't know whether he actually
founded them or not. But the troll factories are seen as an inherent part of
Russia's hybrid warfare arsenal. You know, that information warfare is
integrated into the whole Russian military doctrine, in fact. What we see here
is that the ultimate multitasker, chef, military leader, now claims he's founder
of troll factories. All of these are, of course, duties that are also ones that
the Russian government wants to pursue. Now, at some point or other, he bought
into Wagner, which had already been set up. What do we describe him now as? Is
he CEO of Wagner? Is he commanding officer of Wagner? He is seen as being the
leader of Wagner. And he is definitely seen as being the commander of Wagner.
He's out there on the terrain commanding his troops. And this is a stark
contrast to any of the official Russian military. You don't see Sergei Shogo,
the Russian Minister of Defence. You don't even see Valery Gerasimov, the Chief
of General Staff. You definitely don't see Putin with the troops on the ground
in the theatre of war, the way Pugoshin is. Marina Myron, can we establish when
Wagner started operating in Ukraine? I mean, were they there back in 2014 when
Russia annexed Crimea? Well, after the annexation of Crimea, allegedly, the
Wagner group was deployed to train the opposition in eastern Ukraine. So those
were the little green men, which didn't have any insignia on their uniform, so
nobody kind of knew to whom they belong. And it was also that time when Putin
would deny any sort of connection, even existence or knowing about the existence
of the Wagner group. And we have seen a kind of similar behaviour in Syria when
the Wagner group was used in Syria to do all the dirty work for the Russian
armed forces there. And so it is plausible to believe that that's when Wagner's
operation started in Ukraine. Right, so that's when it started. Were they
subsequently involved in the lower level fighting that's been going on in
eastern Ukraine ever since, do we know? I would assume that they were indeed,
because they also needed to train the units, the resistance units. And so
according to some of the reports that I have read, also the Russian side is
denying any kind of involvement. So we have to take everything with a grain of
salt from what we know. But it would be plausible to say that indeed they were
involved in combat operations. Joanna Dadeish-Pereira, let's go back a year to
the beginning of the current conflict in Ukraine. Were Wagner involved from the
start as far as we know? There were indications that several battalion groups
were moved from Africa, from Mali and Central African Republic before the
invasion of Ukraine. Actually, there are several indications and proofs that
they were moving six months ahead of the invasion. Is it your impression,
Joanna, that because we know that not many people were informed about the
imminent invasion of Ukraine, that one of the people who might have known that
it was going to happen is therefore Prigozhin? Yes. Samantha, where has Wagner
recruited the soldiers that it operates from, the ones who are on the ground? I
presume that some of the initial ones were people who'd been fighting in Africa
and so on, were trained soldiers, but subsequently? Yes. So initially, he was
using his trained soldiers, but there were many deaths, so he had to get more
soldiers. So he went to Russian prisons. And this was a very interesting episode
because he turned up in late August, early September, filmed recruiting soldiers
in prisons and offering them amnesty if they served the six months in Ukraine.
Now, under Russian law, only one person can offer amnesty, and that is the
president. Parliament can sometimes also offer amnesty to prisoners, but there's
a whole lengthy legal process. This was just announced, and Prigozhin managed to
recruit some of the figures that British intelligence has come up with, around
50,000 prisoners. And the first batch of prisoners who survived, because the
figures also point to about an 80% death rate within those Wagner prisons, were
those who survived, and the first batch of prisoners was actually pardoned in
January. Again, on what legal basis? At some points, journalists were asking the
prosecutor general, you know, what is the legal basis for these pardons? And the
prosecutor general couldn't answer. In the end, Dmitry Peskov and the Kremlin
spokesman, and later Vladimir Putin himself, said, these pardons are perfectly
legal, but there are just some secret decrees. So again, we have this opacity of
how he was recruiting. Now he is no longer allowed to recruit in prison. Surely
you don't get good soldiers out of prisons, Marina? Well, it depends on what you
need them for, right? So Defence Minister Shoigu gave Prigozhin a carte blanche
to recruit from prisons. Because as we have seen during the so-called special
military operations, the Russians have seen they have manpower shortage. It
wasn't a bad idea. It was something that is politically acceptable to the
general population, because you don't care, you know, if prisoners die on the
battlefield or if they die in the prison. For the people, it's important that
their sons do not die, because the Russians are still suffering from the Soviet
Afghanistan syndrome. So it was quite an interesting and smart move, both
politically and kind of in operational and tactical terms. Joanna, do you agree
that in effect, the Wagner forces have proved to be more effective, or created
more effectiveness for the Russian forces than the Russian forces had managed on
their own? Well, yes, I think they were more effective than the Russian army.
But this will never be recognised by the official channels. Well, that's very
interesting, because I believe that there was some boasting by Prigozhin after
the capture of a town, the town of Soledad. Firstly, the suggestion is that it
actually was quite militarily significant, that capture. Yes, I think this is
actually one of the points of contrast between what Prigozhin says and what the
Ministry of Defence and the Kremlin officially are trying to pass to the media
and to the Russians themselves. And this is a point of clash as well between
Shogun and Prigozhin. Because when Prigozhin came and his appearance in the
media escalated over the last weeks regarding his victories, the role of Wagner
in the conflict, the role of his men gaining terrain, this was not recognised.
This was not recognised by the Kremlin. And this is not recognised by the
Kremlin because Prigozhin officially doesn't have any formal standing. He is not
recognised as a politician. He is not recognised as an official voice of the
Kremlin. He was until September last year, a tool for the Kremlin and for
Russia. But now this tool has become visible. And visibility in the eyes of the
Kremlin is not a very positive thing, especially when you're not in control of
it. I wanted to add something to what Joanna said about the performance of the
Wagner group on the battlefield. And I think we should be very cautious when
we're trying to compare the performance of a group, which has a completely
different, much more flexible structure to that of the Russian military, which
is much more rigid, and has many echelons of military hierarchy in terms of when
it comes to decision making. And so, upon the first glance, and this is what
Wagner and specifically Prigozhin is benefiting from, is the fact that he can
deliver results because they have some sort of unity of effort. But in terms of
command, and the command structure, when it comes to Wagner, it is completely
different. So we have to be very cautious by what metrics we're trying to
compare the performance of the Wagner group versus the armed forces on the
battlefield, because there are some different underlying issues from which the
military is suffering. And I think that Prigozhin has been kind of trying to
lead by example and to introduce more flexibility and to introduce more kind of
decentralised decision making at the lower levels. Samantha DeBenden, when
Prigozhin was claiming this sort of great victory, and it's not being recognised
by other people in the Kremlin, how did the ordinary Russian people get to know
about it? Well, the Russian government has actually told all official Russian
news outlets to stop mentioning Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner group. But most
Russians are getting a lot of their information from informal information
channels such as Telegram. For those that don't know, Telegram, isn't it, is a
messaging system a little bit like WhatsApp? Yes. Telegram has become a very
important tool both for the far right radical pro-war faction and also for
anybody who wants to express a different opinion and all the anti-war factions.
So Prigozhin's really one of his big ways of communicating is through Telegram,
and it is hard. But the fact that the Russian government has now basically put a
moratorium on talking about him in official channels shows that they are trying,
well Putin and the NOD are trying to distance themselves from him more and more.
There was a very interesting letter that was made public a few weeks ago. It was
a response by Valeriy Gerasimov, the chief of staff, to a group of people who
had asked for information on their loved ones who had been in the Wagner group
and who had disappeared. And this letter basically said that Wagner group is not
part of the Russian armed forces and we cannot give any information on the
whereabouts of anybody who was enlisted in Wagner. So yeah, the Russian people
are relying mainly on Telegram for information on Prigozhin and Wagner. Joanna,
given those conflicts, do you think that Prigozhin sees himself as a rival to
Putin or as a rival to the armed forces? In other words, I suppose what I'm
asking you is what are his ambitions? I think he has political ambitions and he
has been trying to build up his political persona over the last month, at least
since September. On Tuesday, he was claiming that he was in the battlefront and
he was not receiving ammunition. And actually he appealed in a very emotional
speech that his men were dying. So first, he put outside a voice message, then
he put on Twitter and on Telegram, two photographs of their men lying on the
floor dead and also a small short video of another group of men, of Wagner men
in a line kind of morgue and saying, please do not mess with us and help us. And
what happened today, this morning, he published on Telegram that he is going to
receive ammunition and that he's very happy for the support he received from the
Russians and all the people that pressured the government. How do you think
Putin now regards Prigozhin? Now, I think at the beginning he saw him as a tool.
Now he sees him as a competitor. I think now we have an emotional problem again.
And the battle of emotions is a battle that is being played amongst Russian
citizens. So you have on one hand, the leader of your country that doesn't
recognise Wagner officially, doesn't want to have any official connection with
Prigozhin. And on the other hand, you have the doer. And because to the eyes of
the Russians, the doer is now Prigozhin. And this makes him a competitor rather
than an ally. Can I ask both Marina and Samantha, do you broadly agree with that
analysis that Prigozhin has made powerful enemies inside at the top in Russia,
and therefore his position is both powerful and precarious? Samantha? I agree
completely with the analysis and all the public overtures he's been making the
last few days are that of a man of the people. He's the man who's on the ground,
who sees what's happening, who's relating the reality of the soldiers. This will
not go on their fears in Russia. This is going to maybe seem a little bit
heretical. He actually reminds me a bit of Donald Trump, the sort of anti-
elitist millionaire. Except Prigozhin is actually on the ground, and saying all
these things that are going to have resonance. He is making powerful enemies.
There have been videos circulating of Wagner troops practising firing, doing
firing practice, with the photographs of General Lapin and Valery and Gerasimov
as targets. Very interesting. Marina? In terms of kind of his political
ambitions, he might be aiming to replace Sergei Shoigu as a defence minister
who's been in that post for over a decade now, together with General Gerasimov.
He would be a threat if he was to assume any kind of official political position
in the MOD. Because if you look at the background of those in the kind of higher
echelons of Russia's military establishment, they are former KGB, FSB, GU. So
not a lot of them are career military officers. There is a good reason for that,
because Putin doesn't want any sort of possibility of a military coup. That has
been a concern since the Soviet times, when you had KGB kind of you know,
looking at what the army is doing, like one or two agents would be assigned to
each battalion to ensure that, you know, they don't turn against the government.
Samantha, a brief last question to you. And it sounds a bit macabre, but this
was a thriller. There's absolutely no way that Bragozhin wouldn't end up exiting
a top floor window in a high building. Do you think he will actually survive?
Well, I don't know. I mean, it will be very interesting if he does survive. I
mean, the advantages right now he's in Bakhmut where there are no windows left.
So I think if I were him, I'd actually stay there, because it's probably safer.
But he's got definitely a price on his head. I think he's making a lot of
enemies. And if this were a thriller, I think the focus would be on the hitman
who's trying to catch him. Samantha de Bendon there with Marina Myron and Joanna
de Deis Pereira. My thanks to them and to my other guest, Andras Rats. So what
do we take from all that? Well, I think principally that this is a rather
perilous way to fight a war. We'll be back next week. The Briefing Room was
presented by David Aronovich. The producer was Daniel Gordon. Radio 4's Lent
Talks for 2023. Six reflective moments taking inspiration from the Lord's
Prayer, with meditations on forgiveness, fatherhood and finding heaven on earth.
A collection of personal stories from the man who forgave his brother's killers,
to the writer escaping a war zone, to facing despair but finding hope. Sharing
experiences on faith, humanity and how the words of the Lord's Prayer have
impacted people's lives. Lent Talks begins next Wednesday evening at 8.45 on
Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Well now, Radio 4, the bottom line, which this week is
asking how businesses should harness the growing power of artificial
intelligence. Here's Evan Davis. Or is it? Welcome to the Bottom Line, the
programme where we explore the biggest jabber and challenges facing businesses
today. What the heck? Who is that? In this episode, we'll be discussing the
exciting and rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence or AI and its
jabber potential to transform the business landscape. All right, well, I'm
definitely going to intervene here because that was not me, nor indeed did I
write those words, but I have with me Bottom Line's David Aronovich. Nor indeed
did I write those words, but I have with me Bottom Line producer Simon, who will
tell us what's going on here. So Evan, this is an episode about AI, obviously,
so I thought I'd take the unenviable challenge of creating an AI Evan. So what I
did was use a chat bot called ChatGPT that we're going to hear about in the
episode to write part of the introduction to the show and then another piece of
software to essentially mimic your voice. I think if listeners were listening
carefully, they will have noticed the word jabber. It's not a word that often
comes up. Why did AI refer to jabber? Yes, jabber. So the piece of software I
used to mimic your voice was a free edition which only came with a certain
number of words to get the full gamut of the English language you had to pay.
And so, yeah, there is the occasional jabber. It puts jabber in as a
placeholder. Well, look, let's hear a bit more of what it thinks this
programme's about. As companies across industries increasingly invest in AI
technologies to streamline operations, personalise customer experiences and gain
a competitive edge, the opportunities for innovation and jabber are seemingly
endless. It's not entirely wrong. That last jabber was meant to be growth.
Obviously, work in progress because there are many well publicised defects
emerging, but it is undeniable that there have been some pretty striking
advances in AI. And as this is a technology, perhaps like electricity or
computing, that has as many different applications as there are different
businesses, we'll look today at what it means for companies, not just those in
tech, but companies beyond, carmakers to car washes. And I'm joined in the
studio by three guests to talk us through it. And first up is Priya Lakhani,
founder of Century Tech. It is a teaching and learning platform. And Priya, this
is a company that is using AI. Tell us what Century Tech does. So at Century,
we've built a platform where imagine you're a learner anywhere in the world, any
subject, any language, and you have those digital courses, digital content on
our platform. We track the mouse movement of every student. We use AI to
understand how they're learning. So we've blended AI with neuroscientific
theory. So Evan, when does something go from your short term to long term
memory? When does the system need to remind you of something? Are you struggling
in kinetic energy and physics actually because you can't solve equations in
maths? And then the system will predict how you're going to behave before you
behave and then provide you with that little nugget of content to solve gaps in
knowledge to stretch you further. And it's in use with over a million students.
So it's a teaching aid. Is it just saving the teacher's labour? Yeah. Because
you wouldn't have enough teachers to personalise for everybody? So it's solving
a key problem in the delivery of teaching and learning, and that is that we
don't have enough teachers. So yes, I think if you had a one to one teacher or
maybe a two to one, that's the sort of experience that you would be receiving.
But when we have class sizes of 25 to 35 children, and that's only getting
bigger, we need to use technology to try and augment the teaching and learning
experience. So you're the student you can log in and it will provide you with
recommendations. It will fill in those gaps. But because it uses big data, it
analyses data and provides the teacher, this really powerful person in the
classroom with all of the insights. So that's a very, very difficult task for
any human to do. It's not just figure out people are struggling in my class, but
why are they struggling? And an AI can do that with precision in less than a
second. I haven't even heard of this product until we got you on the programme.
And you say a million people are using it worldwide. Yeah, over. Yeah. And are
they paying for using it? Is it a business? Yes, absolutely. It is. I mean, we
do provide it. But it's a social enterprise at heart. So there's a school in
Malindi, which is an orphanage in Kenya that's using it. Obviously, that's
probate in Malawi. We've launched it in Malawi with the Alan Turing Trust. But
predominantly, it's used across British schools and international baccalaureate
schools. All right. Well, there's one application in teaching. My next guest is
Scott Petty, who's Chief Technology Officer at Vodafone. Scott, are you using AI
at Vodafone? Yeah, we certainly are. I think most importantly, actually inside
the business, looking at how we drive productivity. We have masses of anonymised
data inside our network. And we can use that data to better plan our changes in
the network to make sure that we can cope with outside adjustments. A great
example of that would be during a train strike. The flows of people around
London changed in those periods. And we need to make sure we've adjusted our
capacity in the network. We can take lots of data sources and make predictions
about what's going to happen in our network today and adjust the network
parameters to cope with that. We started by focusing on creating what we call a
data ocean, taking all of that data and putting it into one place, bringing in
data sources from lots of different places, and then building machine learning
and AI models that sit on top of that to help us with our predictions. Really
simple things, predicting when equipment's going to fail before it fails so that
we can send a maintenance engineer to replace that equipment to avoid a failure.
Do you employ your own programmers to produce the software that analyses the
data in an intelligent way? We do. Or do you just buy that off the shelf? No,
we've had a big focus on building our own software engineering capability.
Across our Vodafone footprint, we have 11,000 software engineers today, and we
plan to add a few more thousand over the next couple of years. We really see our
ability to understand our data and build those models with our own data
scientists as probably a competitive advantage. See, I think I have, as in fact
a customer of your company, I think I have encountered AI when trying to get
custom service being given access to a chatbot thing in the corner of my screen.
That is AI, isn't it? It is, yeah. Like lots of companies, we use a chatbot.
It's called Tobii. We're really upfront about it being a chatbot and that you're
using it. We use it to help us with customer service, particularly what we call
the low end of the pyramid, the tasks that people ask us about every day. That
allows our contact centre agents to deal with more complex tasks. It also plays
a role in our sales journey, so predicting the right promotion to give you as a
customer when you're interacting with us. Ah, OK. So it's got a sales brain as
well as just a customer service. It can, yes. OK, well, look, my third guest is
Colin Murdoch, Chief Business Officer at one of the world's biggest AI
developers, DeepMind. Colin, we should say DeepMind, a British-originated
company. That's right. And then bought and now in Alphabet, which is the bigger
parent of Google. So you're part of the Google empire. That's exactly right,
Evan. And actually my job at DeepMind is to take AI out of the lab and put it to
good use in the world. I sometimes joke it's a bit like running a dating
service. So let me give you a concrete example. Yeah, let's have some examples
because I want this whole programme to be about actual applications. So data
centres. I think when the amount of compute that is being put into data centres
these days is quite mind-blowing. And guess what? If you just leave computers to
their own device, they get very, very hot. For that reason, data centre owners
have developed really complicated systems to try and keep data centres cool. We
were able to take an AI system and plug it into one of these data centres and
reduce the energy required to keep them cool by 40%, which I think is completely
mind-blowing. A 40% reduction. A 40% reduction. How does DeepMind work? So do
you basically sell your ideas to the parent company, to Alphabet, and then they
take them? I mean, how do you actually work as a business unit? So we operate
through this matching process. So we develop the AI solutions and breakthroughs,
and then my team is responsible for taking those ideas and scouring Google and
Alphabet for various problems that we can solve with this technology. And then
we work with the teams at Google to incubate those ideas. And if it works out,
it doesn't work every time, then we go ahead and launch them. What has failed?
Give us one that hasn't worked. The first version that we did of a battery
saving solution. So one of the biggest requests for Android, which is an
operating system or phones used by billions of people around the world, is
improved battery life. We were trying to predict, based on users' past usage,
which apps they might use next and which they won't. Through that, we can then
use that information to help optimise the Android's battery systems so that we
can extend the battery life. So the first time we tried to do that, it didn't
work out. But we came back with an alternative technique, and in the end, it
worked out. And it's actually brilliant. It's rolled out all around the world
now and saving lots of people, hopefully, anxiety about their batteries running
out. OK. Look, we've got where you're all coming from. And Priya, we should say
you're also on the AI Council, which is what? So the UK government's AI Council
is a body working with the Office of AI in UK government to advise on the
national AI strategy and the rollout of the road map for the UK. So we've got
the kind of the broad picture. Someone, tell me what has happened recently. It
feels like chat GPT is why there is so much sudden conversation about AI. What
has actually just happened? I can have a go at that, Evan. I think what's
surprising, actually, is that the technology that underlines chat GPT has
actually been around for a number of years. What's happened in the last few
months and years is that these systems have been really scaled up. And by that,
I mean trained on very large amounts of data and examples. That's done two
things. The first is these new systems can work on tasks they've not been
trained on before. The second thing, which I think is possibly more important,
is why you've maybe encountered it, is that they've been trained on what we call
natural language. So the way you and I would normally converse, they've been
trained on that so they can interact with you in a natural language way, which
makes them very accessible. And it can do incredible things out of the box, like
summarize a document for you or draft an email for you or write some marketing
copy. I think we're really just beginning to explore what's possible. It can do
a lot more than that, though, right? And I think the reason why it's exploded is
they released it. What OpenAI did was they released this and they made it
available to the masses. People are trying it out. They're seeing how it works
using natural language. I mean, I've been talking about AI for over a decade,
Evan, and thinking if people aren't listening as to how this is going to affect
huge sectors and create disruption and transformation, yet in one morning,
ChatGPT is released. And there's all sorts of use cases. People are using it to
create games. They're saying to ChatGPT, are you familiar with a particular game
and the strategy involved in that game? Can you now create a different game?
They're using it for risk management, which is extraordinary. You know, can you
outline the risks if I were in X business at Y time? And then it's producing
these risk management tables for them. There's a bit of caution because some of
what it does, it messes up. I think that's right. We'll come to that. Yeah.
Brush over the facts and top them wrong. Yeah, it does. It told, I think, one of
our math teachers, the Battle of Hastings was not won by William the Conqueror,
and he was really upset. It made up quotes on Othello, and then it actually
makes up its own sources to the quotes, which means that it's actually quite
difficult to detect by anti-plagiarism software, which is, I think, what most
parent listeners here are sitting there fretting, thinking, is my child using
this to do their homework? But actually, it's pretty extraordinary on the AI
journey. Scott, do you use it at Vodafone? Did you look at it and think, this is
exciting? Yeah, we did. ChatGPT is interesting. We're using it in software
engineering to predict what code a software engineer is writing, it will present
the next function or the next best information to help them be more productive
in the way they write software code. So traditionally, they would have gone and
searched on the internet. They would have looked up a textbook for a particular
function. Now, Codebase can do that for them as part of that process. We're also
using it as a summarization engine, because you can take the hundreds of
thousands of chatbot interactions that we have, and it will summarize all of
those hundreds of thousands of interactions and then give you recommendations.
Now, for humans to do that, that's months and months of work going through and
analyzing that information. I think at this point, we should just talk about,
and Colin, sorry to sort of dump this on you, but the Google versus Microsoft
battle here, because Microsoft is in bed with OpenAI, and they are the people
behind ChatGPT. And they are putting it into their search engine. Suddenly seem
like, my goodness, this is the first real threat to Google's domination of
search for decades. Well, just give us the inside story then. I think it's
important to note that the innovation that underlies these technologies actually
originated at Google and DeepMind. That T for transformer came from researchers
in Google in 2017. And it had BARD, which was its equivalent of ChatGPT for
search, and was going to be built into the Google search engine. And then BARD
made a mistake, quite a basic mistake, about what the James Webb telescope had
discovered. And Alphabet share price really reacted. Subsequent, there have been
so many mistakes discovered in ChatGPT, I'm not sure the playing field is not
very level on all of that. One of the reasons I think at DeepMind, we're very
careful about this, and we don't just roll it out to the world and make it
accessible just like that, is because we believe it's really important to be
bold, but also responsible with this technology. There are these inaccuracies
that can arise in them. And one way you can help with that is through using
human evaluators to work with these models to give them feedback. AI is really
too big and too important to move fast and break things. And that's very
important to the way we operate. OK, and we'll come on to some of those things.
But look, firstly, just some vocabulary that people might need to know. There's
AI, there's generative AI. Is that what ChatGPT is? What's the generative?
Generative, it's creating text, media, images using those language models.
Gotcha. And that's not to be confused with artificial general intelligence,
which is what? Yeah, ChatGPT doesn't understand the concepts it's talking about,
has a large language source that it's leveraged, and it can accurately predict,
in most cases, what you thought was going to come next. And that's why it feels
human-like. It doesn't actually understand what it's saying to you. It doesn't
understand the words. It understands how one word sits in a sentence with
another set of words. But does it understand the word? So artificial general
intelligence is something that would actually understand what it's doing in much
deeper words. And artificial general intelligence, as we define it, a deep mind
is a system that can perform well across a whole range of different tasks at the
same level as a human being. And we're really just at the very early stages of
that. OK, just answer me this. A business tool that has emerged in the last,
well, emerged in the 1980s with a company called Lotus, is the spreadsheet,
right? And for listeners who don't know spreadsheets, it's really just a
ginormous blank table that you can put numbers in, and then you can manipulate
those numbers and add columns together and turn them round. And it's a
ubiquitous business tool. You can put your cash flow and accounts in there. You
can trace the numbers of people watching your film. You can look at whether a
solar panel is worth installing. You can create anything you want. Is AI a
business tool like that? Is it as big as the spreadsheet? So in a spreadsheet,
the human is inputting all of those numbers. The human is then having to decide
the relation potentially between one column or one row and another cell
somewhere else in the spreadsheet, and then creating, you know, maybe
visualisations of the correlations between one and the other. Now, imagine all
of those numbers filling up in a spreadsheet, but you're actually using
unstructured data. So when a human inputs those numbers, you've got that bias,
haven't you? Because you're thinking of all of the different data fields that
might relate to one another. With an AI, you're using big data. You're using
data that potentially you have no idea whether one column would relate to a
different column or a different row. And you can then use algorithms and you can
train models upon all of that unstructured data to then come up with predictions
and analyses that would, as Scott was saying earlier, take months, if not years,
for a human to come up with. So it's like a spreadsheet on steroids. It's a
super-powered spreadsheet. The best way to think about it, a spreadsheet can
have hundreds of thousands of data points and you can use it to help you analyse
them. An AI can have bazillions of data points from many, many different sources
and make much better predictions in the areas that can help you in your
business. Well, look, okay, I'm going to quiz time now. So I'm going to name
some businesses and I want you to give me some ideas as to how AI might be
useful. I run a car dealership. I'm listening to these three people who
definitely drunk the Kool-Aid and get it. Give me the kind of things I should be
asking myself as to how I might be thinking about this new suite of stuff that's
rolling in. First of all, you have to work out where is my data and how am I
going to get that data in a place to help make those predictions? And that's the
biggest problem for all companies to solve is how do I get it out of my
financial management system, my spreadsheet, all of those things. How do I get
into a place that these models can apply to sit on top of that? And what
external data sources could I have that could help me? So if I'm a car dealer,
how do I connect into the manufacturer of those cars to get their data about the
supply chain, the features of the car? I need all of those data sources to be
able to apply whatever AI or chatbot models I think about on top of that. So two
of your biggest issues as a car dealer, right, is that you have to ensure that
you've got the right cars at the right time. Right. So you could use artificial
intelligence to start tracking who's coming in, what's the demographic of those
customers, what's their income levels, how much have they purchased in the past,
and then you can start to use artificial intelligence far better than a human
would be able to to predict which cars do I need at what point in the year. The
second thing is let's say you're a really large car dealer, right? You then have
connections to your entire supply chain and we obviously know with cars in the
last few years the issues they've had with supply chain. Now if you had
historical data on the supply chain, and let's say there is a pandemic and there
is a regional shutdown, you'd be able to predict in advance the disruption to
your business and be able to then create processes in your business to mitigate
the impact of that disruption. I'm a car dealer, I'm not a tech person, big data
handler type person. Is someone going to produce a piece of car dealer software
that all car dealers will buy? Is there going to be a piece of generic software
where you kind of tailor it to your business needs? How do you see this
evolving? I mean because clearly the car dealers are not going to personally
hire programmers to kind of get into big data analysis. I think we're going to
see a couple of things, Evan. The first is I think AI will get integrated into
the tools that car dealers already used. And going back to our discussion
earlier around generative AI, what's one of the amazing things around that is
it's very easy for anyone to just pick up and use. I think as the technology
evolves, it may also be able to do really interesting things like send an image
to the customer about how the car might look with their minutes so they can
begin to experience the car they would like to buy before they've arrived at
your showroom. The other thing that's going to happen is large providers of AI
systems will make their AI available through cloud services, which will allow
other businesses with expertise in the car dealership industry to build AI
systems that are relevant and useful to you as a car dealer. Should a window
cleaner be thinking about this? Is that something which is going to be useful?
Do you want a scalable window cleaning company is the question that I would ask
you. I mean you're managing your own business. You may well be using AI right
now. So for example, if you're using accounting software to help you do your
bookkeeping, to invoice, marketing software in the local town, it depends if
you're using technology for that, then you know you might have the sole trader
who's not interested in looking at a screen because they've got enough panes of
glass in front of them every single day. Well, look, we've talked about some
specific applications. Very helpful to hear about actual examples. Tell me what
are we going to use AI for and humans for? Clearly, humans are going to have a
place in all of this for the foreseeable. I mean, do you think about that,
Scott? What is the AI doing and what's the natural intelligence doing? We do.
What AI is really good at, if it has the data sets and the models, is
prediction. In our case, changes in traffic patterns, failure of equipment, the
question that someone's going to ask us on our chat bot. You have to balance
that with how accurate is the answer that it's giving? Are you sure of the
traceability of the data sources that it's coming from? Are you sure that it's
not biased in the way that it's creating those answers? Are humans curating and
deciding whether that's a good answer to give to humans or not? Those are things
you need to think about on the ethical side. Presumably, Toby, gets cleverer
because it evolves as it goes. It does. We keep training it and we keep focusing
on how do we improve those journeys. Some are just too complex. The technology
is not good enough today to solve those, but it solves a huge percentage of the
things that customers want to interact with and that's something we measure
every single day and it's in the high 70s to low 80%. On the AI generated chat
bot, because most customers' problems are fairly regular problems that other
customers have gone through as well. Yeah, and they're asking things about their
account that are really easy for the chat bot to answer. Evan, in the education
sector, this is the key question, right? What are we actually educating young
people for in the future? And so it's really important to differentiate the HI,
the human intelligence and the AI. What's really, really shocking is the UK
comes top. We won the gold prize for the country where memorization strategies
is the key to passing any assessment. Now, what we all know from learning stuff,
recall and regurgitation, rote learning, in exams. And so the problem with that,
of course, is that we've all seen with chat GPT, well, it can do that pretty
well and it's only getting better. Every second anyone's on that system, it's
being trained further. So in education, we need to separate that HI and AI and
so there's been so many reports over the past couple of decades, whether it's
the World Economic Forum, whether it's OECD saying it's about all of those
skills, to do with collaboration, leadership, kind of all the skills that we
actually learn often in sport, drama, music, all of those subjects that actually
have become less important in the English curriculum. And what I think what we
do need to do is have a dramatic shift from our current education system where
it's currently focused to one that can augment AI to superpower the human
intelligence. You don't want to over invest in getting people to do calculations
mentally if there's calculators ubiquitous. Yeah, exactly. It's how to use the
technology, how to apply it. You do want people to understand the calculations
they're doing on the calculator, but not necessarily to be as fast as the
calculator. And we still need our researchers, we still need our scientists, we
need our innovators. So it is about having a breadth of curriculum that can
teach us all of these different types of knowledge and skills together. Another
example is in drug discovery. It's impossible for the human to imagine all the
different molecules that could be important to solve a disease. There are more
molecules than there are atoms in the universe, way, way, way more. So it would
take a human way too long to explore that space on their own. But with an AI
tool to assist them, they're able to produce a drug more quickly that we hope
will be more effective to treat disease. As Colin was saying, actually, one of
the most phenomenal advances of artificial intelligence is to be that teammate.
Say with diagnostics and screening in health tech, which we haven't talked too
much about, it can be absolutely phenomenal where you don't have enough staff.
So think about radiographers, how many radiographers do we need? And how many...
Brilliant. This is a brilliant application. Absolutely. So I do know that
DeepMind have been working in this area, obviously. And then we have amazing
companies like Chiron that have MIA, which can buddy up with a radiographer who
might look at, for example, breast cancer screening. I've actually got a good
friend who's a radiographer called Mike, and I've had this discussion with him.
I remember having the discussion a few years ago, and he was sure that actually
it wasn't going to change the way he worked. But it has actually, because the
system he's now used is being trained on millions and millions of different
images. It's like having an expert radiographer sit by you. And so now what
happens is the AI system can surface examples to Mike and his friends, and they
can then much more quickly identify what might be wrong and what might not be
wrong. Yeah. I suppose it does take you to a world where the humans do the kind
of the interesting stuff and the machines do the more routine. Well, one of
the... This is a fascinating example for me, as we think about a kind of cleaner
and greener energy future. There are people trying to build nuclear fusion
reactors for many years. It's like building a mini star on this planet so we can
generate cleaner and greener energy. It's very, very difficult to control that
mini star. It's very unstable. If it touches the sides of the reactor, it breaks
down immediately. And there are very clever people that have spent a lot of
time, humans this is, human intelligence, trying to develop algorithms to
control these plasma stars. And very recently, we've been able to develop an AI
system that's been able to control the plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor at a
much greater level than has ever been possible before. And it worked
fantastically well. And I think that is an incredibly exciting application of
AI. Look, we've had a good conversation about some of the applications. Let's
just think about the businesses in the business of AI itself briefly. And
interestingly, there are some quite sticky intellectual property, IP issues,
aren't there, about who owns the data on which they've been training the AI.
Priya, talk us through that. There's a recent case of, you know, Getty and
Stability AI. There's a class action suit in the USA as well. And so if you
don't know Getty Images, they essentially are an aggregator of images. A
massive, massive library of photos. A huge, like one of the biggest players in
this area. And if you want to buy an image off Getty Images, you have to pay
Getty Images. And then they obviously have, you know, a model with the creatives
that originally created the images. So there have been allegations, this is by
Getty, to Stability AI, which has created stable diffusion. So they're creating
generative AI and images have trained on the Getty image set. And Getty have
said, well, if you have done that, then you owe us the license fee or the
applicable royalties. Now, the generative AI companies are saying, well, it's
fair use. And say, what we have to do is separate what is the data trained on,
what's the input to create these generative AI images. And then you have to
separate that from the output. Now, if what you're outputting is an image that
is exactly the same sort of image, which is very, very significantly similar,
then there is typical sort of trademark and copyright law over the output of
that image and its similarity. I think the controversial area is the input. You
know, what are you allowed to mine in order to create your generative AI
technology? And that will differ across different jurisdictions. But the
difficulty with artificial intelligence and technology is that it's global. It's
a minefield. Colin, is this a big issue at DeepMind? Yeah, I'm not an IP expert,
so I'm not going to speculate on how exactly it works. But intuitively for me,
it feels like there should be room for agreement. Because as humans, we learn
and develop and we do things inspired by other people's work. And as long as we,
if we reproduce some other work, we recognize that, then I think it's generally
accepted in society that that's okay. I think there's a really important area
that builds on this that all businesses should think about, and that's related
to privacy. And they're far more likely to get on the wrong side of the line
related to privacy than to IPR laws. Do you have permission to use the data that
you're using to train the models that you're now using within your business? If
you're taking your customers' data, have they explicitly given you permission to
use that? I think what another area, Evan, that's really, really important here
is, if you're a consumer of these images of this media, did you know that it was
developed by a generative AI? The technology that I know that some companies are
trying to develop is watermarking technology. Very much like a banknote. It
hopefully wouldn't impact the aesthetic of the image or the text, but somehow
there would be a watermark embedded in that so you could tell it was generated
by an AI system. Well, look, I hope at least we have stimulated our audience to
think about the multiplicity of different things that AI can bring. Thank you to
