 Women's World Cup for the first time and we'll hear from one of their players.
This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio station. At two hours GMT,
you're listening to the newsroom from the BBC World Service, coming up. The
message is clear. It doesn't matter what Russia tries and how it attempts to
undermine international order. It fails one time after another. The United
Nations General Assembly resoundingly banks a resolution demanding that Russia
immediately withdraws from Ukraine. It's the 24th of February, a year since the
invasion began. I'm Gareth Barlow in London. And I'm James Waterhouse in Kyiv,
looking at how the past year has shaped Ukraine. In the next half hour, as James
says, we'll explore how a year of war has affected Ukraine, shaped global
security and led ordinary people to do extraordinary things. We'll also explore
what the near future holds for the conflict. Ukraine has to demonstrate its
counterattacking capability. It must show its Western backers that the huge
amounts of weaponry, training and money are actually making a difference. You're
listening to the BBC. Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News. As Ukraine marks
one year since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the United Nations is
overwhelmingly back to call for Moscow's forces to pull out immediately. More
than 140 countries voted in favour of a resolution condemning the war. Only
seven opposed it. 32 others abstained, including China and India. The French
Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the result sent a strong message. 141
states expressed their support for just and lasting peace in Ukraine. 141 states
once again strongly condemned Russia's aggression and called on Moscow to
respect international law. This support from an immense majority of countries
from all continents confirms that Russia, more than ever, is isolated. Our UN
correspondent in New York, Neda Taufik, says the resolution is largely symbolic
but significant. I think what's important here is for the average person
wondering, you know, where do countries stand on Ukraine? Well, this gives them
that answer. It really just underscores, again, the overwhelming nature of
countries that remain concerned about this war, about the global effects of this
war, and the fact that you have Russia, a permanent member of the Security
Council, violating one of the most basic principles of international law. And
then you have others who feel that, yes, those principles are incredibly
important, but this resolution won't help advance peace. Poland has started
fortifying its border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, the Polish
government says there's been a rise in flights into Kaliningrad from Turkey and
the Middle East. It fears migrants arriving there will be encouraged by Moscow
to cross into the European Union. North Korea has test-fired four strategic
cruise missiles into the sea. The state news agency said the missiles travelled
2,000 kilometres, adding that the drill demonstrated the conflict readiness of
what it called Pyongyang's nuclear combat force. It's the latest in a series of
provocative weapons tests that have increased tensions on the peninsula. The
former Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 16 more years
in prison at a court in Los Angeles for rape and sexual assault charges dating
back to 2013. He's already serving a 23-year sentence following a separate
conviction in New York. After the sentencing, one of Weinstein's accusers,
Caitlin Dulaney, spoke outside the courthouse. These cases are often tried later
after they've happened and these things don't happen in front of other people.
So to get a conviction here and a strong sentence, so I'm very proud of all of
us who have been speaking about what Harvey Weinstein did and supporting the
women who testified. Hopefully we'll make it harder to get away with these kinds
of crimes. World News from the BBC. A court in Sierra Leone has ruled that the
main opposition candidate for June's presidential election will have to stand
trial over allegations of corruption. Samurai Kamara was chosen as the candidate
for the All People's Congress three days ago. He's denied any wrongdoing and
says the case is politically motivated. Boeing has temporarily suspended
deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner again in order to conduct analysis on a
fuselage component. The aerospace giant recommenced deliveries of the jet last
August after they had been halted for more than a year due to previous problems.
Boeing said there was no immediate safety concern. A senior federal investigator
in the United States has called for an end to the politicization of a rail
disaster in Ohio. Jennifer Homandy was announcing the findings of a preliminary
report into the crash, which caused a major chemical spill three weeks ago.
Enough with the politics. I don't understand why this has gotten so political.
This is a community that is suffering. So I don't care about the politics. What
I care about is figuring out how this happened. But I can tell you this much.
This was 100 percent preventable. Every single event that we investigate is
preventable. So our hearts are with you. A rare blizzard warning has been issued
for parts of Southern California from early Friday through to Saturday evening,
with millions of residents told to brace for unusually cold weather and snow.
Forecasters are predicting a record snowfall of more than two meters in
mountains to the east of Los Angeles by Saturday. The National Weather Service
says the last time that LA was under a blizzard warning was in 1989. BBC World
News. You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with me,
Gareth Barlow. It's a grim anniversary. As dawn broke in Ukraine one year ago,
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. Its military attacked
from the north, east and south, and so began the biggest conflict in Europe
since the Second World War. The cost has been huge. The UN estimates at least
8,000 Ukrainian civilians have died. Millions are homeless or refugees. Cities
have been flattened. As many as 100,000 Ukrainian troops are dead or wounded.
And Russia's losses are even higher, as many as 200,000 casualties. Twelve
months have passed, and with the war showing no signs of ending, the UN General
Assembly in New York has now overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on
Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine, both immediately and
unconditionally. Before the vote, China's UN representative, Dai Bing,
criticised Western military support for Ukraine and called for peace talks. We
support Russia and Ukraine moving towards each other, resuming direct dialogue
as soon as possible, bringing their legitimate concerns into the negotiation and
setting out feasible options, putting an early end to the crisis and giving
peace a chance. For their part, speaking after the vote, Ukraine's Foreign
Minister, Dmitry Kaleba, said Russia could not ignore the result. We are
satisfied with the outcome and the message is clear. It doesn't matter what
Russia tries and how it attempts to undermine international order and the
coalition in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity. It fails one time after
another. Well, let's cross to our North American correspondent, Peter Bowes, who
joins us live. Peter, what does this vote show us about where the world stands
on this conflict, on this war, one year on? It shows us that the world is in
about the same place as it was a year ago, with overwhelming opposition to
Russia's invasion and the ongoing war in Ukraine. The resolution reaffirmed
support from 141 countries for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and it rejected any Russian claims to the parts of the country that it now
occupies. Seven countries voted against, 32 abstained, including India, South
Africa and China. The French Foreign Minister said Russia can and must stop
tomorrow. I don't think anyone in that room expected that to happen, but that
was the sentiment of the room. Her Japanese counterpart said next year we should
not meet here to mark the second anniversary of this senseless war of
aggression. With regards to this resolution, with regards to this session of the
UN General Assembly, what does it mean in real terms? Is it just a symbolic vote
or is there some implication of it? Well, it has no legal implication, so it is
largely symbolic, but it does show where the moral weight of the world is right
now, and I think that is the significance of it, that overwhelmingly countries
believe and support Ukraine's right to exercise self-defence, and that's
significant coming from this body, of course, which has at its heart the goal of
keeping peace around the world, and at a time when in some quarters support is
waning. Here in the United States, for example, Gareth, there are some in the
Republican Party more openly now questioning the amount of money that the United
States is spending on providing arms for Ukraine. There's no questioning the
Biden administration's commitment, as we've heard from the President over the
last few days, but I think what we've heard from the General Assembly is a
global statement of really steadfast support for Ukraine. But the reality is
Russia will turn a blind eye and a blind ear to that global statement, surely?
It won't have any impact or certainly very little impact on Russia's, let's say,
battlefield strategy. I think where it could make a difference, difficult to
quantify though, is in the arena of psychological warfare, that this is a
message to President Putin that there remains this globally strong resolve to
oppose Moscow's war. Peter, Peter Bowes, following that UN vote, thank you so
much. So that is the political situation in New York, but what of the lives of
those people directly involved in the conflict? Our correspondent Clive Myrie
was in Ukraine when the war broke out and has been to Izium in the east of the
country to follow the accounts of a Russian soldier and the diary of a Ukrainian
woman who were experiencing the invasion at the same time. On May the 2nd last
year, Izium was under Russian control, but Ukrainian forces were hitting back
with heavy artillery. One Russian conscript, on the phone to a friend, doesn't
want to fight. We are ending up in Izium. They are sending us straight to the
front line, a hellhole, just as cannon fodder. And to go there is f***ing mad.
On the same day, Lyubov Listuk writes a new entry in her diary. She's been
chronicling her feelings about the war from the beginning. May 2nd, 2022. It is
impossible to walk without tears. God, this is hell. The entire city is scarred.
Smoked walls, homes without roofs, without windows, piles of bricks, glass and
debris. I don't know how people survive. That's so powerful, reading that back
now, almost a year on. How do you feel? Now when I read it, it's always painful.
It's really tough. Two months later, on July the 22nd, the fighting for Izium is
intense. The Russian hold on the city is precarious, and one soldier calls home
to his wife. How are things going? Yesterday the heat was pretty bad. And what
about leave? If I go home, I'm not coming back. There were 40 men left in our
unit, now only 20. And caught in the middle are civilians like Lyubov. Down
here? To escape the fighting, she was hiding in a damp and dark cellar. July
22nd, 2022. Apparently, two people were killed. I am frightened again. Just when
I was thinking about leaving. On September the 6th, Ukrainian troops entered the
city. Writing down her thoughts was the only way Lyubov could cope with the
trauma of her city's occupation. This has been the scariest year of my life. So
little joy and laughter. So much fear, pain and tears. I hope I will write that
we won this war long ago, and we have peace. That report by Clive Myrie. Well,
millions of Ukrainians have been displaced since the war began. And around the
world, many people have opened their doors to host refugees. One such family are
the Baskins from London. They're a Jewish family and they saw the plea for help
from a Ukrainian woman and her two sons and decided to welcome them in to their
family home. Initially, they thought they were offering support to strangers,
but have since discovered a surprising link between their families, which goes
back generations. Daniela Relf reports. For almost a year, Anna Likholit and her
two sons, Alex and Mark, have lived with Shelly Baskind and her family in North
London. We just wanted to help because we felt that as Jewish people, we've kind
of been in a position where we needed help. As everyone got to know each other
better, Ania told Shelly about her grandfather, Nikolai Diki. During the Second
World War, he took in Jewish families, hid them from the Nazis, saved their
lives. Years later, Ania's grandfather was awarded a medal by the Israeli
government for his courage, honouring him as righteous among the nations. When
she told Shelly about him, something clicked. When I got the photo of the medal,
I looked at it and I thought, I know this. That's so weird. I've seen this
before. It's the medal that my grandfather produced when he was alive. Neither
woman could quite believe it, but archive records showed Shelly's grandfather,
Moshe Hecht, had made the exact medal awarded to Ania's grandfather. When my
grandfather was alive, he had a factory for metal work in Israel. So he produced
medals for people who the Israeli government gave medals to. And Ania's
grandfather was one of them. It's unbelievable. And when I told my mum and my
father, it's, no. Maybe it's another situation. Yeah, but it's true. Do you
think this will be a lifelong friendship for you both? Yeah. You're stuck with
each other now. Yeah. We're like family now. That remarkable story brought to us
by Daniela Ralph. And we'll have more on the situation in Ukraine later in the
programme. But I want to step away for a moment to talk to you about the
disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. That's because it looks
likely he'll spend the rest of his life in jail, following a court in Los
Angeles sentencing him to 16 years on rape and sexual assault charges. That's in
addition to the 23 year sentence that he's already serving. It was allegations
against Mr. Weinstein that fuelled the Me Too movement. And dozens of women have
spoken out about sexual harassment and abuse by powerful men since then. Well,
our US West Coast correspondent, Sophie Long, was following the court case and
says that one of the victims, known only as Jane Doe, told the court that
Weinstein's actions had ruined her life. The sentencing hearing started with
Jane Doe reading out a victim impact statement. And she talked about how she
carried the trauma of what had happened to her in 2013 with her for many years.
She said she'd been a happy, confident woman until that point. And on that day,
all that changed. She felt that she couldn't touch her children. Now, just as
Judge Lisa Lynch was about to issue the sentencing, Harvey Weinstein himself
spoke up and said he wanted to address court. He thanked the court for allowing
him to speak. He said he would stand. He was sitting in a wheelchair in prison
issue clothes. And he said, I would stand, but I'm not able to. He said, I am
innocent. I do not know her. He said, referring to Jane Doe, she does not know
me. We do not know each other. He said this didn't happen. And he talked about
how a cottage industry had begun with lawyers making money out of the
environment post the MeToo movement. In the run up to this trial in Los Angeles,
a lot of women in the film and entertainment business said to me that they felt
the momentum of the MeToo movement had stalled. But I think today is really
important. One woman said to me is that it gives them hope and it feels like
justice. And people are using words like elation. And we have to remember that
Harvey Weinstein was referred to as the sheriff of Hollywood. In a couple of
weeks, we'll have the Oscars. A lot of A-list stars stood on an Oscar stage and
thanked Harvey Weinstein. Some used to refer to him as God. It's hard to
overstate what a change has been seen since the inception of the MeToo movement
all those years ago. The voice there of Sophie Long. Well, let's take a moment
now to look at some of the other stories leading the day's agenda. Peru's
government has declared a state of emergency in more than a dozen areas. That's
because of an outbreak of dengue fever. So far this year, the illness has killed
16 people and 11 and a half thousand cases have been recorded across the
country. That's a rise of over 70 percent compared with the same period last
year. Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes and often found in tropical
areas. A billionaire financier and investor has been found dead from a reported
self-inflicted gunshot wound at his office in New York City. The death of Thomas
H. Lee, who was 78, was confirmed by his family in a statement. Mr. Lee is
credited with being one of the early pioneers in private equity. And hundreds of
historical artefacts are being unearthed over the years and now gathering dust
in warehouses. That's because there's not enough storage space in museums in
England. Talks are underway, though, with the British government to open a
national archive that could then loan the artefacts to museums because there are
fears that the treasured pieces of history could be lost forever if a solution
isn't found. Well, let's turn our attention now to the world of sport with
Richard Newman. Thank you. We'll start in Wellington, where England's cricketers
are batting first in the second test for New Zealand. After losing the toss,
Stefan Schemmelt is there watching for us. England are 204 for three and Harry
Brooks at it again with his 400 in six tests and probably the best of the lot.
He arrived at the crease when England were 21 for three after being put in on a
pitch, had plenty in it early on. But he's batted beautifully in reaching three
figures from 107 balls. Brooks had it 183 with Joe Root, who's 59 not out.
There's been a real master and apprentice feel to this partnership. And that
pitch that was difficult to bat on earlier is looking much easier in the
afternoon. Brooks has 116, England 204 for three. Stefan, thank you. Well,
staying with cricket, Richard, we now know one of the finalists. Don't we, for
the Women's T20 World Cup? We do. The reigning champions, Australia, the first
team through after a thrilling five run win over India in Cape Town. Really
tense finish. Australia look like they might be heading for defeat until India
skipper Harmanpreet Kaur was run out for 52. That was a decisive moment.
Australia, though, we know that they're ruthless. Their opponent could be their
biggest rival. England's play host South Africa on Friday. Let's turn our
attention now on to some football. Two European heavyweights have shown that
they might, might possibly be on their way back to the top. Yeah, it looks like
a football fan's been treated to a brilliant Europa League playoff between
Manchester United and Barcelona. United through to Friday's last 16 draw after
winning 2-1 at Old Trafford to go through 3-2 on Angkor Ghat. And just thinking
of the two teams, they've been defined, haven't they, by a legacy of old
managers. Are they moving past that now, do you think? It looks like it's well
known that Manchester United have struggled since Alex Ferguson left. It's 10
years ago now. Under Eric Ten Hag, United much more confident, more disciplined.
They've kind of got their swagger back. He said after this result that he feels
like they can beat anyone. Similarly for Barca, such a good side under Pep
Guardiola. Now under another former midfielder, Xavi, they're eight points clear
at the top of their Liga. It's an indicator, though, that they've been
struggling over these years because this was in the second tier Europa League,
not the Champions League. So that's Man U and Barca. What about the other
significant results? Juventus looked impressive, beating Nantes 3-0 to go
through 4-1 on aggregate. But the Dutch giants Ajax are out, losing 3-1 to Union
Berlin, who've been so good in Germany this season. Richard, Richard for the
moment, thank you so much. You're listening to the Newsroom on the BBC World
Service. We return now to Ukraine. A year ago, the BBC's James Waterhouse was in
Kiev for just six weeks. And then the Russian invasion began. Since then, he's
covered the conflict and spent time with Ukrainians whose lives have been
irrevocably changed by that war. I caught up with him and asked him how the past
year has affected the people of Ukraine. I remember in the weeks building up to
the invasion, people would very calmly say to me, well, we will fight. You know,
it's about defending my country. It's about defending my very existence and my
children's future. And at the time, you know, it was it was quite a thing to
hear. But you sort of thought, well, you know, may well never come to that. How
do you know until that moment comes? But on the whole, they were serious about
it. I think you had the resilience of the general population who have had to
learn to live with this. You've had the volunteers who signed up in their
millions. And then you've had the transformation of Ukraine's military and
weaponry. And I think Vladimir Putin miscalculated. Whenever I drive around
Ukraine, I think two things. Firstly, you can see why Russia wants to take it.
It's this vast, fertile landscape. And the second thing I think is I can't
believe Russia thought it could take it, given its vastness. It should have
taken it. It was the far superior, bigger force. It still has huge mass over the
Ukrainians. And yet the Ukrainians still managed to stay to the defence they
are. To what degree on the ground and amongst the ordinary Ukrainian population
do they feel continually supported by the West? We see often lots of calls, that
frustration etched on the face of Volodymyr Zelensky calling for more weapons,
faster weapons, weapons to be delivered more quickly. But do you feel as though
Ukraine still feels that sense of brotherhood with the West, with NATO? I think
in a political sense, they are clearly grateful for the help that's been
provided so far. But you're right, they are frustrated with the rate it has
arrived. Before this invasion, what people cared about was who's helping us and
with what. And there was frustration aimed at Germany, who was initially
hesitant and sending in January military helmets and hospitals. You know,
Ukrainians say, well, I can't fire those. And I think that's been the sentiment
ever since. But when you talk about brotherhood, I think it's more like a
neighbour across the road that they feel. Because despite the political will of
Ukraine as a whole on issues of wanting to join NATO and wanting to join the
European Union, they ultimately have not been realised. And so you have Ukraine
sort of falling through the gap. I think people feel that. And I think that is a
deep source of resentment for the majority of Ukrainians. Thus far, both the EU
and NATO have been non-committal of just when that will happen. At the moment,
it's kind of political platitudes on saying one day, yes, our future is
together. A sense that the country is to some degree being kept at arm's reach?
I think so. I think I've seen a lot of official visits come here. And you see
Ukrainian flags crossed over with the European Union flag or the UK flag or the
US flag. And messaging is vital in war. And you see Ukraine is trying to push
itself westward. And we've seen in times gone by, whenever Russia's aggression
increases, Ukraine leans further to the west politically. This full-scale
invasion has kind of blown that out of the water. But it's still reaching. It is
still not fully incorporated into these wider blocks towards the west. It is
throwing everything westwards politically to try and achieve that, whilst trying
to throw everything in a military sense towards the east to keep Russia at bay.
And ultimately, you know, it still hopes to repel Russia completely. But it
feels a long way off from that point. James Waterhouse, well, let's finish the
programme thinking about that point that James has just made, the military
situation on the ground. Dr Jonathan Marcus is a former BBC correspondent and
now an independent diplomatic and defence analyst. He gave us his assessment of
the conflict now and the outlook for the next few months. This is not last
year's war. The stakes are just as high, but the two armies have changed.
Ukraine's forces not just survived the shock of battle, but have fought back,
inflicting reverses on the Russian invaders. All this came at a cost of heavy
casualties, and Ukraine is busy trying to build up new brigades and divisions
for the offensive to come. On the other side, many of Russia's best troops were
killed and their units shattered in the early stages of the conflict. Moscow has
had to mobilise tens of thousands of poorly trained conscripts. It has enlisted
convicts and it has had to reach deep into Soviet-era stockpiles of weaponry to
equip its newly organised formations. All this sets the scene for what could be
the most critical period in this conflict. This latest phase will be a drama in
two acts. The first, a Russian offensive in the east, largely focused on
securing more of the Donbass, is already underway. It is likely to build over
the coming weeks. Ukraine's aim will be to inflict heavy losses on the Russian
forces, to try to conserve its own combat power as much as possible, and then to
launch what will be the second act of the drama, to go onto the offensive
itself. Many analysts believe that Ukraine's goal will be to drive southwards,
to sever the so-called Russian-held land bridge, the band of Ukrainian territory
that links Crimea with Russia to the east. Everything now depends upon how
successful Kiev and Moscow have been in generating, training and equipping new
combat units. Resolving problems in ammunition supply will be crucial for
success. By the time spring turns to summer in Ukraine, we should know how
decisive this new phase of the fighting has been. For Russia, stalemate may be
enough. But Ukraine has to demonstrate its counter-attacking capability. It must
show its Western backers that the huge amounts of weaponry, training and money
that it has received are actually making a difference. Western support for
Ukraine remains strong, but if the war does turn into a stalemate, would there
be similar levels of backing, say, this time next year? Perhaps. And this is
maybe President Putin's lifeline. There is no real balance in this conflict, and
it goes way beyond the fact that Russia is the larger, and on paper at least,
the vastly stronger player. The war is being waged on Ukrainian soil. It is
Ukraine's towns and infrastructure that are being destroyed. And for Ukrainians,
this is a national struggle for survival. Of course, Mr Putin would like
Russians to see the conflict in similar terms. Perhaps some do. But slowly, as
the casualty toll hits home and economic sanctions begin to bite, what then? And
surely, in Mr Putin's mind, there must be one other fundamental question. How
will Russians judge this misadventure when the guns eventually fall silent? The
thoughts of Jonathan Marcus, ending this edition of the Newsroom programme. But
there is plenty more insight and analysis on the first anniversary of the
initial invasion of Ukraine by Russia on our website. Just head to bbc.com slash
news. This is the BBC World Service exploring the seriously fun work of the
Flying Seagull Project. My name is Captain Bash. Ash has been on a mission to
bring fun and frivolity to disadvantaged children. Children in refugee camps, in
orphanages and care homes. These kids probably have gone through some of the
worst traumas and they don't have access to counsellors or therapists. Ash and
the seagulls aren't therapists. They're clowns. So they do what they do best to
help. Escapism and fun. Give them something to wake up excited about. Give them
something to go to bed giggling about. Otherwise what is the point? When the
Greek government allowed children in refugee camps to go to school, the kids
who'd been working with the seagulls did far better than the other kids. If they
can believe themselves to be limitless and valuable, then maybe they can go into
the next challenge of their life with that arsenal of self-confidence. Flying
Seagulls. Child's Play. Tuesday at 9.30 and 20 GMT. Hello, I'm Manny Jasmy. On
this week's World Football we hear from Haiti defender Chelsea Supreze. Haiti
have just qualified for the Women's World Cup for the first time. In recent
years Haiti has been rocked by natural disasters, a presidential assassination
and sexual abuse allegations by female players against several men in its
football federation. So Supreze says she's proud of putting the country on the
map for positive reasons. Join us in two minutes. BBC News with Neil Nunes.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed a vote at the United Nations
calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops. The
resolution was backed by an overwhelming majority of countries which Mr.
Zelensky described as a powerful signal of global support. Friday marks exactly
a year since the full-scale invasion began. Poland is fortifying its border with
the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The Polish government fears that migrants
from Turkey and the Middle East are being encouraged to travel to the area where
they could cross into the European Union. North Korea has launched four cruise
missiles into the sea. It's the latest in a series of provocative weapons tests.
A court in Los Angeles has sentenced the former Hollywood film mogul Harvey
Weinstein to 16 more years in prison. The rape and sexual assault charges date
back to 2013. He's already serving a long sentence for another conviction.
Madagascar's government says a powerful storm which battered the island's east
coast has killed at least seven people. Cyclone Freddy is now heading for
Mozambique. A senior federal investigator in the United States has called for an
end to the politicization of a rail disaster in Ohio. Jennifer Homandy was
announcing the findings of a preliminary report into the crash which caused a
major chemical spill three weeks ago. Boeing has temporarily suspended
deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner to conduct analysis on a fuselage component.
The company restarted deliveries of the jet last August after they had been
halted for more than a year because of other problems. And a rare blizzard
warning has been issued for parts of Southern California from early Friday
through to Saturday evening. That's the latest BBC World News. If you could
describe like a perfect night for me it's play like a five a side match and then
go home shower up and get dressed. Go to a fancy dinner. Yeah go to a fancy
dinner. That's a great day right there. Get a girl that can do both. Leading the
conversation on the global game. This is World Football on the BBC World
Service. Hello I'm Manny Jasmi. Welcome to the program with me the former
Chelsea and Everton winger Pat Nevin and the former USA international Heather
O'Reilly. Pat just a few months ago we previewed the Champions League final
between Liverpool and Real Madrid and you cautiously said that that Liverpool
team of last season might just have been the best that you'd ever seen. This
week Liverpool played Real Madrid again went 2-0 up and lost 5-2. So what's gone
wrong in this difficult season for Liverpool? Yeah I mean first of all Manny
makes a bit of a difference. Salah's not been the player he was before although
he can do it in sparts. In the big big games they were always able to turn up
before. This season they've just been out chased, been out ran a lot of the
time. They've missed Van Dijk for a good period of time as well and he was
probably for that period of time the best defender in the world. He's come back
and he's not quite the same. There seems to be problems all over the place but
the biggest and the simplest problem they've got is they're having to
restructure and they're having to change and it isn't easy. So they've kind of
reached a peak. I think the peak had probably just gone over last season but now
the peak has gone and I think people know that and that's why a number of young
players have been brought in and it might take them a little while. There's a
lot of teams doing it. Chelsea are doing the same thing just now and it's
painful when it goes wrong because Real Madrid were fabulous. They were utterly
fabulous. My thoughts on it were Real Madrid were playing like Barcelona.
That'll offend a few people but you know the great Barcelona side of a few years
ago. It was a joy to watch such good football. Heather, the USA have won the She
Believes Cup, an annual four-nation tournament after winning all their games.
Before the tournament Megan Rapinoe said that she hoped that the team would be
metaphorically punched in the face, get a bit of a wake-up call to prepare them
for the Women's World Cup later this year. Did that happen? Did they look like
they needed it to happen and can it actually happen? Is there enough strength
and depth in women's football for teams to go and metaphorically punch the USA
in the face? There is enough depth. I think that the teams that they played in
this tournament, Japan, Brazil and Canada are all teams that can do that to the
US. None of the teams did that to the US so I don't think that there was this
punch in the face. On the contrary, the US won but sort of once again did it in
an unconvincing manner to the supporters' dismay. They keep winning the games
but it's just done in a way that is a little bit unconvincing. Everybody is a
little bit worried when the World Cup comes around. Did they get punched in the
face? No. There was a goal that was pretty much the last play of the entire
tournament. Ludmilla from Brazil scored against the US to make it 2-1 just the
other night in about the 88th minute. It wasn't a punch in the face in terms of
losing the game but I think that they'll come away from the tournament happy
that they won. They won all three games but that last play of the last game will
definitely stick with them. One area of concern I see for the US team is they're
just allowing far too many crosses into the box. Again, against Brazil you have
two minutes left. You have to block the cross. You have to block the cross. Pat,
one thing I'd love to know your opinion on. All these players, this new age
generation, everybody's putting their hands behind their back to defend. Maybe
at the highest level of men's football or women's football, once in a while a
crafty player can almost serve a ball in and hey, if it hits the hand it's a
benefit, go to the penalty spot. But for the most part, it's not going to hit
your hand. You have to defend regularly. You have to defend well. It's far more
dangerous to not defend well and to kind of make your body small, put your hands
behind your back and allow a cross in the box. And so I'm watching the US and
I'm like, they are allowing crosses in the box so they don't hit their hand. And
I just think that that's insane. So that's one correction I would like to see.
And I think when I think about, you know, the old school versus new age players,
I think I do get a little, you know, OK Boomerish. I don't know if we can even
say that on BBC because some people might be offended by it. OK Boomer. The
Boomer generation, you know, is… That would be me. Yeah. Is that you Pat? Yeah.
People are what, maybe 50s. So that's old school. Then you have me. I'm a good
old millennial. And now you have this Gen Z generation, right? And everything
with the Gen Z is about what it looks like. Everything's online. You literally
need to put it online or it didn't happen, right? So I'm on my high horse right
now that these kids need to be a little bit grittier and just block the cross.
Just take the cross, you know. Nothing's better, Pat, you know, as a winger than
having somebody stand 10 yards off you with their hands behind their back. You
can place a cross wherever you want. So did they get punched in the face? No,
they just got like a little scrape on the nose. But maybe if anybody's listening
to this program right now on the US team, I just punched him in the face. Right.
Well, as the United States prepare for the World Cup, three debutants have
completed the lineup. Panama, Portugal and Haiti are to join the other 29 teams
in Australia and New Zealand later this year. For Haiti, it's a rare cause for
celebration. In 2010, an earthquake killed 200,000 people and was followed by a
wave of cholera, which claimed nearly 10,000 more lives and has recently
returned. The country has also been battered by hurricanes, seen a presidential
assassination and is in the grip of gang violence and social unrest. And in
2020, investigations by FIFA and the global players union FIFPro documented at
least 34 alleged victims of sexual abuse, including children at the National
Football Centre. So Haiti's World Cup qualification is welcome news indeed, and
they'll take on the European champions England, Denmark and China at the
tournament. Shortly after their historic victory over Chile, I spoke to right
back Chelsea Suprese at the team hotel. She was born in the USA to Haitian
parents. Yesterday was in fact a dream for all of us. There's not many words to
describe it, and a lot of us will continue to process it. We did exactly what we
knew we could, which is to prove to the entire world that Haiti is is a force.
And we were able to exemplify that energy in a positive way and get the exact
result that we were looking for. What was it like afterwards in the locker room
with their tears? It didn't even take to get to the locker room for the tears to
start. To be honest, we were some of us, including myself, were absolutely
bawling as soon as the whistle blew. Either you were crying, either you were
smiling, either you were just screaming as a part of release. It all just came
together in such a beautiful form. I think all of us just held each other so
tightly and we really just embraced each other, all of us. You grew up in the
United States where women's football has been a big deal for a long time. So how
special is it for you to have qualified for the World Cup and to be at the same
tournament as the United States? It means the world to be able to achieve
something this great, not only our girls on this team, but for our country. It's
definitely something that we need, that Haiti needs, that makes us so proud to
represent our country and wear the crest on our chest. It's no secret that Haiti
has struggled and is still struggling, but we are bringing something so
incredibly positive to Haiti and to our people. I think it's everything that we
could have hoped for and the gratitude that we all share in our hearts is a
feeling like no other. Why did you decide to pursue an international career with
Haiti instead of having a go with the United States? I had played with the US
national team in the youth level and for me at the end of the day to play for
Haiti was to play for my family. Although I was born in the US, Haiti is in my
blood. It's my family, it's who I know. So it was pretty much a natural decision
for me and it's an honour to play with Haiti. For many people, whenever the
Haiti women's team has been mentioned, it's always been in the context of rape
and sexual abuse allegations against members of the federation over years and
years and years, all of which have been denied. How much of a shadow has that
been over the national team? We're not shook by this. We're not shook by any of
the struggles we've ever had. We have many struggles. You could name in any
various order what they could or currently are. But I think we as a team, our
current federation and our current staff choose to not linger on the past or
negativity or things that could continue to bring us down, but instead to try to
improve and always grow. I'm very proud of all of our girls and of our staff,
the way that we have handled moving forward and honestly rewarding ourselves for
all of the hard work that we've put in. OK, well, let's look ahead to the World
Cup. One of the teams in your group is England, which is probably alongside the
United States, favourites to win the entire competition. On Wednesday, they
played a very good Belgium team and beat them 6-1. So how are you feeling about
that prospect? Well, we are just excited, number one, to qualify. I think
everybody is super quick to talk about what's next and who we're playing. But
we're not foreign to playing big teams, matching up against top teams and being
the underdog. We're going to go in to compete and we're not scared of anyone.
And that's exactly what we're going to show, that we can play and we deserve to
be there. And regardless of who we're going to play against, we're going to
treat it with the maturity and the relentless competitive spirit that we've
always shown. Maybe it's too early to ask you this question, but when you
imagine yourself at the World Cup, what's the picture that you see? Well, to be
honest, just for you to even say when you imagine yourself at a World Cup is an
insane statement to actually be living in currently. So let's just start with
that one. But I think the most I would imagine is seeing the national anthem
side by side with my teammates and hear a roaring crowd to just be in such a
surreal moment where you are just speechless. It's going to be incredible. I
tell you, one person who is listening to this interview is Heather O'Reilly.
She's mentioned all the great strides that the Haitian women's team has made.
And I'm sure she'll be absolutely delighted for you and the achievement that you
and your teammates have recorded. Oh, wow. I would send her many thank you. She
is a legend and I know many players all over the world, including myself, know
of her history. And it would be such an honor for her to even be speaking in a
positive way about Haiti. Thank you very much indeed, Chelsea. Enjoy the status
of being a Haitian history maker. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me.
And I wish you all the best as well. That's the Haiti right back Chelsea Sapris
speaking to me from Auckland and looking forward to her debut, the country's
debut at the Women's World Cup later this year. Heather, I hope I wasn't remiss
in mentioning you and putting words, associating words with you and offering
your best wishes to Chelsea. No, Manny. I mean, we're like the same person
nowadays. We've spent so much time together, me and Pat. We speak as one voice.
Please just always speak for me whenever whenever you feel inclined to. No,
thank you for saying that to her, because what they did accomplish was
phenomenal. And she just sounds so, yeah, just so excited, so proud, so joyous
that she's representing Haiti. You could tell that it means a lot to her and her
family. And Chelsea also mentioned how much it means to the country and just to
be able to provide this joyous moment, one that sort of distracts people, I
think, of their previous tough times. What an achievement for the team. I know
the entire country will be tuning in this summer. So well done. Well done. Well
done, Chelsea. And yeah, maybe the US will be seeing you if we both advance in
our groups. And I wish you guys the best of luck. So well done. Pat, as we
discussed last week a little bit, whatever anyone thinks about the merits of
expanding tournaments, you can't overlook the joy that players like Chelsea are
experiencing because they've been allowed to qualify for this tournament. Yeah,
I mean, you can feel it, you can hear it. And it's and especially because the
growth of the women's game has been so quick. You know, in the last couple of
years, it's really exploded. And I think they all know now that they're not just
going to something that their friends are talking about. This is now a worldwide
thing. Tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions will be watching. I'm
delighted she's got that attitude, but I'm also delighted she said, yeah, but we
play against some big teams. We are capable of holding our own. She wasn't just
saying we're going to turn up, you know, and expect to be easily beaten. I mean,
it's going to be tough for them against England, but, you know, they've given
some tough times. Did they play against the US recently? They did, didn't they?
3-0? 4-0, I think. 3-0, 4-0. Yeah, it was closer than it has been in years past.
That's for sure. So they are improving. Yeah. And I watched the two goals that
got them through. De Mornay, she's with Ream, I think. And honestly, what a
powerful player, but what a brilliantly balanced player. They've got some good
players in that team, so it's one of those ones where, and they win, was it 21-0
against the British Virgin Islands? I don't know how much we're going to take
out of that, but don't take them for granted. I think they will get results in
this tournament. It might not be against England, but I think they will get
results. So it's brilliant to hear the excitement, but it's also great to hear
they want to be competitive. Exciting times for the Haitians. We'll see them in
a few months' time on the biggest stage. Football resumes in Turkey on Saturday
with Fenerbahce playing Konyaspor in the Super League. The season has been on
hold since the devastating earthquakes struck nearly three weeks ago, killing
more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria. Among the dead was the Ghanian
player Christian Atsu and the sporting director of his club, Heterspor, Taner
Savut. Heterspor and Gaziantep are among several clubs who have chosen to
withdraw from the rest of the season. None of them will be punished with
relegation. Adana Spor, who are in the second tier, have also decided not to
continue playing, leaving players like the Gambian international Lamin Jallo
scrambling to find a new club in order to keep playing. We are a bit down when
we hear that the president said withdraw from the league. Other players are
looking for a club, so it's a bit of a disappointment for me. I saw two teams in
the Super League, that's Heterspor and Gaziantep. I think Hataya cannot play
because they lost their director and one of their star players, Atsu. So I think
Hataya is a good move, they don't play football at this time because it's a bit
difficult. In Adana, we are two teams. In my club, all the players are safe and
the president, everybody in my club are safe. For me, my thinking is we can
continue the league outside Adana. That's what Adana Demispor do in the Super
League. They will continue their match, I think, in Antalya. For us, our
president just withdrew like that. It's a bit crazy. I was so nervous because
now we are in a rush, everybody is looking for a club. We are a lot of players,
so you talk with some clubs, they will not offer you good offer. They want you
to come just for loan. What the clubs want and what I want, it's a different
story. So still now I'm waiting. It's a bit crazy. What was it like for you when
the earthquake happened? On the 6th of February, we were sleeping. My house and
some buildings collapsed. I think it was a thunder. I think it was a thunder.
But after, when I heard the house shaking, my house was shaking for 20 minutes.
I cannot describe it because everything was shaking. So I was a bit scared. I
was thinking today I will not survive with my family. But thank God, I see
myself still now. With my family, we have to run out to be in the car. I have
two kids. I have to run down to pick up my boy and upstairs, my baby girl was
there. So I have to catch them with my wife and run outside to go straight to
the car. But after Adana was not safe, we run back to our club facility that's
30 minutes outside from Adana. So me and my family, we settled for all the
night. But to be honest, it's a bit scary. It's a very difficult moment. The
last two, three weeks, very difficult. Which clubs are your agents talking to?
Clubs like in our league, they are in the playoff zone. They are talking about
the Shankar Sport, Bolo Sport, Umraini Sport, that's a super league. Umraini
Sport and Istanbul Sport. But still now nothing because they are not offering
good offers. They are taking other players. So that's why still now I'm waiting.
So for you, it's how much they will pay you that's really important. But I guess
at some point, you will have to think that if you don't go anywhere, you won't
play for at least six months. Definitely, I want to play. I want to play
football because we have an important game also on the national team. That's
next month we have to play qualification against Mali. I was doing good in the
league, you know, playing week in, week out. But now without playing, you know,
you cannot go to national team at the moment. So, I mean, just tell us what your
situation is like at the moment. I mean, where are you living and how often are
you contacting your agent every day and saying, have you heard anything? Is
there any news? You know, my agent is Italian, but he don't have a lot of market
in Turkey. Last two days, we signed a mandate with one Turkish agent. He's a
good guy. So he's helping me. At the moment, I'm here in Istanbul safe with my
family. I'm training at the gym every day, morning and afternoon, waiting for a
good call to continue playing. They're transferring the clothes next month on
the 5th. So we'll see till the last minute, but hopefully 100 percent I will get
a team. That's Adana Sport striker Lamin Jalloh speaking to me from Istanbul.
Pat, it's lucky for players like Lamin Jalloh that the transfer window is still
open in Turkey. And he sounds pretty desperate, doesn't he, to find a team?
Yeah, everyone always thinks footballers are multimillionaires. All of them are.
But it's not really the case. And there's a lot of players that have to work
very, very hard to get by with not only for themselves, but for their families
and sometimes for those that are dependent on them as well. So, you know, it's
not being insensitive by him, you know, so soon after the earthquake to say, no,
I need to get back and get back to play football. Because, you know, his own
security, his own family's security, you know, is in doubt. So it's absolutely
no fault of his own whatsoever. But you need to try and put yourself out there.
And it's a difficult situation because there's quite a few players in a similar
position as him just now trying to get another club. So I can just say good luck
to him. He sounds as if he's been through a huge amount, as is everyone else in
Turkey and of course Syria as well. Finally, the end of season playoffs in Major
League Soccer in the United States have been changed slightly so that there will
be a best of three matchup in the first round. So two teams will play each other
three times. And Pat, this gives us the perfect excuse to recall the Merseyside
Derbies in the FA Cup in which you played. And I'm pretty sure actually they
were in February, or at least some of them were, because there were plenty of
them in 1991. So just tell us about those. What's it like when you play the same
team over and over again? Well, it's bad enough, any team, but it was when it's
your rivals, it's Everton versus Liverpool. It's extraordinary because you know
each other far too well. You try to make some tactical changes. The first game
was a draw at Anfield, as I remember. We should have got a penalty kick. I still
bear the scars. We didn't get it. Of all the penalty kicks I didn't get in my
career, that's the one that hurt most. Then there was a 4-4 draw in the next
game at Goodison Park. To which point everyone just decided not to defend. We
just went running chasing. It was one of those magical, magical nights where
anyone who was there or even watched it live on television, because it was the
early days of showing games live on television, it was extraordinary. And then
we managed to go and win the replay. So it was extraordinary, but it's also that
feeling of, oh, it's you again. And you have to try and rethink and reinvent.
And that's harder for the creative players. It is harder because you have to
recreate something different. And whereas the defenders, they know how to
defend, they know how to work, they know what their job is. So it's not great.
However, in the midst of all this, Manny, I don't even understand what they're
trying to do in the U.S. here. What do they mean, three games? I mean, what, did
they add up the scores? Explain. I don't understand. No, no. Yeah, you know
what? There's some technical logistics that I'm still trying to sort out myself.
But I think the whole point of it is you want the best teams to advance. And a
best of three series allows just more chances for the better team to come out on
top of the series and therefore advance through to the championship or further
down the championship rounds. Can I suggest that's what's a league. That's the
difference between a league and a cup, right? In a cup, these things happen. So
that's why you have cups. In a league, they can even itself out. So this is the
problem with getting the playoffs at the end of the year to get the
championship. You're turning a league into a cup. And that's why you have to do
it. Another thing I need to correct. I mean, I sound as if I'm complaining here
because I am. What about the baseball players? Now, again, fill me in on my lack
of knowledge here. Do they play six games against each other in a row or
something like that? They're not going to start doing that in the playoffs.
Well, sometimes there's a doubleheader in the same day, Pat. Can you believe
that? They play two games against the same team in the same day. It's nothing
sacred. You know, any time that something is brought into this game that's
different, people are a bit up in arms because, yeah, some of the traditions are
very sacred. But I think that it's worthy to look at some different ways of
doing things. And if people don't like it, you know, you scrap it for the next
year. But worthy of giving this a try and an interesting format that I'm sure
was well reviewed and talked about before. No draws are allowed in this best of
three matches. So at least they can't go to any replays. That's it for this
week. Best of three in Major League Soccer. We're down to the best of four in
world football. Just four more episodes left. The first of those is next week.
Join us for that. Until then, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. World Football is a BBC
Sports production for the BBC World Service. No place like NAMM. Saturday at 12
GMT. In 50 Minutes, Witness History. With me, Josephine McDermott. Today I'm
taking you back to the Chinese city of Shanghai during World War II. I've been
talking to a former foreign resident, 93-year-old Christopher John Huckstep,
known as John, who was a child living under Japanese occupation.
