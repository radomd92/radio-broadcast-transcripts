 Just say open BBC sands to get started BBC News at 9 o'clock the Human Rights
Organization Amnesty International has Criticized the decision to continue
denying Shamima Begum British citizenship eight years after she fled the UK to
join the Islamic State group Ms. Begum left her home in East London as a
schoolgirl to travel to Syria Today an Immigration Appeals Commission found
there was credible evidence that she had been trafficked But decided that factor
did not overrule the government's national security concerns Steve Valdes-Simons
from Amnesty International UK says it was the wrong decision. It is a position
that puts citizenship fundamentally and improperly at risk The fact is she is
British and this country should remain responsible for its citizens Just as we
expect other countries to be responsible for theirs The British retail
consortium says disruption to fruit and vegetable supplies in the UK is expected
to last for a few weeks Tesco and Aldi have today announced that they are

News In half an hour here on radio 4 Katie Russell asks What are the lessons for
the media in reporting missing person cases in the media show? But on radio 4
the word controversy almost always accompanies any reference to ECT or
Electroconvulsive therapy for mental illness. It's one of the most contentious
treatments in psychiatry But as Sally Marlow discovers in shocking for some
people ECT is the only treatment that works You're rolling okay, so the first
bit is really easy your job title I'm Dr. Tanya Gergel and I'm the director of
research at Bipolar UK and Also an honorary senior research fellow at University
College, London Was that okay? Yeah, that was great. Thanks. This is Tanya. We
met at work at King's College, London She's seriously impressive bright
compassionate quick. Very very funny We became friends and I'm about to
interview her in a small BBC studio about the most personal of personal subjects
I've got emotional before when I've interviewed people, but I've never really
interviewed a friend like this before Yeah, and I've done interviews about this
before but I've never done it with people that I feel close to yeah Yeah, we're
all in uncharted waters Tanya is a philosopher and an internationally respected
medical ethicist and she also lives with a serious mental illness an Unusual
mixed type of bipolar disorder which brings severe depression and mania at the
same time It's a terrifying and very dangerous condition and Tanya tells me that
the only treatment that works for her is ECT or electroconvulsive therapy How
many times roughly do you think you've had an ECT treatment? I suppose one thing
I should say is that the number of treatments I've had is very very unusual
before I say the number because I Wouldn't everything about you is unusual. I
Think I've sort of lost count, but I when I've tried to work it out. I think
it's probably close to It's Close to 200 I would say close to 200 ECT treatments
I wasn't expecting that and she was first still in her early 20s So ECT has been
a regular feature of her life for almost 30 years When I'm severely Unwell, I'm
very strongly compelled towards taking my own life I say that when I am severely
unwell I want to be treated with ECT that it is the only treatment that works
and it's saved my life on a number of occasions the seriousness of Tanya's
illness Contrasted with a matter-of-fact way. She describes ECT brings me up
short The word controversial is almost always part of any statement about this
treatment What are you thinking when I say ECT? One flew over the cuckoo's nest
shock therapy Bodies convulsing darkness cruelty and punishment And maybe you're
the same Floating around in my own family history is a much-loved aunt who had
ECT and the secrecy even shame around it then Yet my capable intelligent brave
friend describes ECT as saving her life Bringing her back from the brink back
into her life as a scholar a wife a mother to two girls Tanya and I talked about
making a radio program about ECT and then just over a year ago She became ill
again. But this time she kept audio diaries in which she recorded her mania I I
just feel good. I Don't feel tired. I want to stay up if I stayed up all night I
could probably master the Bach piece. I've been trying to play on my marimba if
I stayed up all night playing And her terror just before bedtime on Tuesday
evening and the one thing that I thought I had going for me earlier on was the
presence and their voices had Lifted but as I was getting ready for bed, they
became strong so strong that I couldn't fight them off I Want so much to be able
to step outside of my head I don't know if just for a day just not to be trapped
inside this mental prison Listening to the audio recordings. I found very
difficult and I haven't actually listened to that many of them yet you've been
able to bravely Offer some of those tapes for us to use in this program. I know
why I think that might be important but why do you think that's important I
debated with myself a lot about whether to make those available to other people
and I've also talked to my family about it because I Wouldn't do it unless they
felt comfortable. Of course One of the things I think when talking about ECT and
saying well, it's treatment for very severe illness or life-threatening Illness,
it's so difficult for people to Understand what that actually means So with
Tanya's blessing here we go. I want to test my own preconceptions about ECT How
do I know if the frightening and distressing images so many of us have are the
right ones? Well, Tanya's gonna show me what it's actually like We're going to
meet the ECT team at the hospital where she's cared for and I'll hear about the
first patients who like Tanya Depended on ECT to restore them back to health But
first we need to go back to the 1960s to find out about my auntie Joyce So I'm
sitting at my mum's dining table. She's called Kath in Skipton in North
Yorkshire Yeah, mom. I told you about my friend Tanya who has ECT and it made me
realize that We'd never really talked about Auntie Joyce your older sister who
also had ECT. We we never really talked about that Did we know we didn't because
it wasn't a subject that was discussed in my generation people were just
Compartmentalized if that's the word as just having nerve trouble Trouble with
your nerves now. We realized that it was more than that This is in the 60s that
she had ECT wasn't it? Hmm. Nobody talked about the ECT Absolutely not. No, and
why was that? Why did nobody talk about because? People didn't talk about mental
health. Sorry Even my mother would keep it low profile from me And the
difference between me and my sister was probably I reckon about eight years She
was eight years older than me and we always looked up to her because she had a
medical background because she was a nurse All I remember was my mother Gran
used to go to my sister's When she was having this treatment And she would have
to be there And she would have to be there for when the children came from
school Because she knew when my sister came from a treatment That she would be
out of sorts and you talk about the treatment. Did you know what the treatment?
I just knew it was electric treatment. That's how Joyce described it to me
They're going to try this electric treatment What did you imagine was happening?
Well, I imagined they were putting electric currents through a body It was
almost as if it was a last resort That they would try this to try and give us
some kind of quality of life I can't remember what she was like when she was ill
because when I was very little What was she like? What was her illness like?
Well to be fair, Sally, I never really saw when she was ill because she used to
lay low Until the time came that she had to go again for more treatment, but in
between times I can only think That yes, it was like a slur I remember her house
was always open to everybody. Oh, absolutely kids and dogs Absolutely cups of
tea in the kitchen and you were very close to her and looked up to her and
everybody did but Growing up as a kid. I had no idea About how ill she was Well,
really Sally neither did I because she didn't want it to be an issue Since i've
been aware of Tanya having ECT You know, I've talked to people about it and the
reaction is often Do they still do that? And there's clearly a difference
between when Auntie Joyce had it and now when Tanya's having it And I just feel
like I need to Get to the bottom of it for Auntie Joyce as well as for Tanya. Do
you know what I mean? I do know what you mean, Sally and I'm I'm, really pleased
that you are doing this delving And trying to get some answers for the family
for me And for her son there was always this shadowiness about this treatment I
can't imagine what it must have been like for Auntie Joyce a remarkable woman
taking care of everybody else while experiencing episodes of crippling mental
illness So I started to delve ECT involves passing an electrical charge through
the brain to induce a seizure which typically lasts between 15 and 45 seconds
Seizures were first induced chemically in America in the 1930s By a Hungarian
neuroscientist called Laszlo Maduna And then Tanya told me about someone who's
not only written about Maduna But was also his contemporary and actually met
him. My full name is Maximilian Fink, but I am Max Fink I'm a physician
professor of psychiatry and neurology I graduated medical school in 1945 When I
was 22 years old and At this age of 100 I am surprised I'm still here Max Fink
is known as the grandfather of American ECT. He told me what first set Laszlo
Maduna on his trail one of his patients Had been a catatonic. That means he had
been mute Had to be soup fed. He had to be washed etc And this man after he had
four or five seizures suddenly woke up and said Where am I? Who am I? Maduna was
inducing seizures with chemicals, but the real breakthrough came at the end of
the 1930s When neuroscientist Ugo Celletti and Lucio Beeney developed a way to
induce seizures using electricity Max explained what happened. These two men had
a patient who came into the hospital and was in retrospect a catatonic Their
first choice was by accident an excellent accident They made a box Attached it
to the electric current in the room And then they put two electrodes and put it
on the head of the human And the electrodes were charged And suddenly he had a
seizure They went ahead and gave him a few more seizures Nothing happened until
about the fourth or fifth day And he was calm It was very easy to manage They
then Treated a number of other patients and that was the beginning of
electroconvulsive therapy Fast forward and now every year globally around 1.4
million people have ECT 2,000 of those in the UK Here it's approved for
treatment resistant severe and sometimes life-threatening depression A course is
usually between 8 and 12 treatments and crucially the guidelines say that if it
works for people they can choose to have it Incidentally Tanya is a world leader
on the ethics of decision making and consent in mental health Even published in
the Lancet psychiatry And she champions individual control and autonomy for
people over their own care We know Tanya is unusual to have had so much
treatment, but the fact is she consents to it So today I went to the hospital
and signed the consent form for ECT I will feel cut off from everyone cut off by
some uncrossable gulf that I'm watching them from the other side Critics of ECT
point to the fact that it is sometimes given without consent In the UK apart
from Scotland ECT is regulated and monitored by the ECT accreditation service
ECTAS which is part of the Royal College of Psychiatrists They report that more
than half of patients do give consent for treatment and when they don't it's
generally because they're too ill and they're detained, being cared for under
what's known as a section A year ago when her illness returned Tanya went to
hospital for her ECT by choice as a voluntary outpatient Now she's well she
wants to show me what modern ECT looks like Tanya we're here now at Northwick
Park in North West London at the Mental Health Centre What's it like for you now
being here when you're not here for treatment? It is very strange but then at
the same time being here with you is very different It's nice to come in a
different persona And you've talked to me a lot about the team here Are you
looking forward to seeing them again? I'm really looking forward to seeing them
They've helped me through the periods of my life which have been the hardest and
I've got to know them, we've become very close Thank you! And this is the point
I think when I'm coming for treatment where I start to I don't know you just
feel like a little bit apprehensive It's a little bit strange, a little bit
surreal being here These circumstances This is the ECT suite Nice to see you
Good, good, good I'm Cathy Queen and I'm one of the ECT nurses here in the
clinic I've been doing ECT from as long as the 1980s A long, long time And you
know Tanya very well? Oh yes, I've known Tanya I think since she was a little
girl How long Tanya I think since, how long Tanya? It must be about 15 years 15
or 16 years now I'm Anjali, I'm the ECT manager and lead nurse for the clinic
here in Northwick Park So shall we go through to the ECT suite? And can you,
Cathy and Anjali, can you show us how it all works? Yes, come this way Thank you
So this is it, this is the room I would just think this was a regular treatment
room There's a bed in the middle, standard medical stuff Lots of light coming in
through the windows I mean there is equipment here that I don't know what that
is And presumably that is something to do with the treatment, is it? Yes, so
that's the anaesthetic machine we've got there Difficult airway trolley, crash
trolley We've got our ECT machine here that delivers the treatment And Anjali,
I'm looking at the bed and I was expecting to see restraints And I can't see any
No, so most of our patients are consenting And we wouldn't be restraining anyone
to have ECT here This button here is what delivers the treatment So you
literally press it and hold it down? Yes, so I'll hold it down until it stops
making a sound To indicate that the treatment is finished And then once I've
done that I will start monitoring the visual seizure So it will be like a little
quiver of the lip Or the eyes flickering or the toes So yes, very quick, a
couple of seconds And then the treatment is finished There's a muscle relaxant
as well that is administered at the same time As the general anaesthetic so that
actually your body doesn't really convulse There's no major convulsion of the
body because there's a muscle relaxant Yes, the convulsion is not very strong So
the treatment's given, there's a seizure Angela, what happens then? Tanya will
start to wake up How long does that take? So it varies for each patient But it's
only a couple of minutes that they're in here in the treatment room for Tanya,
when you're lying on the bed and you get the anaesthetic What's going through
your mind? What does that feel like? Strangely I find it quite relaxing When I'm
very unwell, experiencing the more psychotic symptoms Sometimes then I'm very
afraid But it's not fear of the physical procedure It's fear actually of just
everything I always remember Kathy who always holds my hand Like she's just done
now So the people who hold my hand, I usually picture my family And have a nice
picture in my head and then just go off to sleep And it is actually quite a nice
feeling You say, think of something nice, a nice holiday And I think that helps
Let me come to Angela I'm just wondering what reaction people have to you When
they say, oh what do you do? And you say, I'm an ECT nurse The first thing that
people tend to ask me is Oh my gosh, does that still happen? So it's just about
explaining to people It's not the way that the movie's portrayed It's not how it
used to be It's done under general anaesthesia now What is it about what you see
happen That makes this what you want to do? I think one of the main things is
just seeing How quickly patients get better in such a short space of time And
the feedback that we get is just amazing And they say things like ECT has just
completely changed my life It's turned things around for me so quickly I'm so
happy to have my life back So it's that kind of feedback that just keeps you
going And wanting to work in ECT And just be part of breaking down that stigma
That is very much around How do people react to you, Kathy? Because you've been
doing this since 1982 How do people react to you when you say that you're an ECT
nurse? I explain it as it's no different being medically unwell And if you were
going into hospital for it to have a toenail removed You have a general
anaesthetic and ECT is extremely safe It's been really eye-opening, thank you
both And thank you Tanya for bringing me here and letting me explore that The
use of muscle relaxants and anaesthetic Along with the dignity and respect shown
to patients at Northwick Park Really changed my perceptions of ECT Plus there's
no denying that there are stories of recovery I'm just waking up from my sleep
after today's ECT Which was number 9 And I don't know if I feel a bit different
I don't know how I've known on previous occasions Whether this has been, in
quotes, the one And whether suddenly the psychosis has lifted Tanya's voice is
different now I can tell she's getting better But Tanya is just one person and
an extraordinary one at that I wanted to know how typical is her experience? I'm
Professor George Kirov I work for Cardiff University And I'm the ECT lead for
this area So I organize the ECT delivery for patients in the Cardiff area
Usually the recovery is gradual But sometimes it can happen just after one
session These are experiences that we remember And everybody who is there
remembers them You see the patient before the ECT Mute, looking at one point Or
mumbling something And after the seizure, so that's say half an hour After the
seizure they've woken up The patient is having a cup of tea and chatting Now
these are not that common We see this once or twice a year maybe So not every
patient would react that quickly But if you see that, you're converted to ECT I
think it was fairly immediate that I felt better This is Sue, a retired social
worker in Cardiff For over two years she'd been dangerously ill In and out of
hospital and repeatedly suicidal And then just before Christmas she had ECT for
the first time in her life And the delusions that you described as well, did
they... They debated, yes I haven't got any of those anymore And you said almost
immediately after the first treatment? As I recall, yeah, it started to work
fairly quickly The suicidal thoughts disappeared And plans for suicide
disappeared So that was a big one, and just lighter in myself Not sort of
burdened with depression and negative thoughts really How much were you getting
back to yourself, if you like? I'm pretty much there I've started playing
badminton with a friend I've been casting a play I'm socialising with friends I
would say I'm 90% there My husband, his way of putting it is I've been returned
to factory settings And would you agree with that? I would actually, I would
George, the programme that we're making is about the group for whom ECT... You
know, they describe ECT as a life saver for them Which groups of people does it
work best for? Yes, this is a very easy question Because there is a particular
group of people that really get well with ECT Somebody with very severe
depression So severe that they can develop delusions, psychosis They start
imagining things that are wrong The evidence is that 80-90% of such cases should
get better And this is the experience that I get in this place Many critics of
ECT talk about very serious side effects Some even say brain damage What are the
known side effects? So there is no evidence that ECT causes brain damage This
has been shown in a variety of studies It does not lead to dementia either This
has been shown in large population studies What it does is it does cause memory
problems What I usually tell patients is that they'll have problems remembering
things That happened around the time of ECT and maybe a few months back Things
like meetings that they've had, visits that they've had Phone numbers, PIN
numbers, these things can be forgotten It is to do with the so-called
autobiographical memory So things that have happened to us We could forget them
spanning a few months back I listened back to an earlier recording just now
Found details of a day trip that I was supposed to go on And couldn't because I
was having my first ECT To some museum or something And the strange thing was
that even though it was not very long ago I can't remember this at all It's as
if it never existed, never happened I realise increasingly with each day That my
memory of recent events is just disappearing You've said to me several times,
remind me of this We've come back to talk to something and you've said Oh I
can't quite remember that You've had nearly 200 treatments you reckon How do you
think it's affected you? There are so many times when I'll be there with my
family And I'll say, oh I've never been to the Brecon Beacons I'd love to go And
they were like, well actually we were there We were there for a couple of days
Just before Christmas last year Even when they tell me, even when they show me
the photos It's as if I'm seeing photos As if I've been photoshopped into
something That I really have no memory whatsoever of being there Do the memories
ever come back, the ones that you've lost? Some do, some don't So there's memory
loss And there are certainly people who have had bad experiences of ECT I asked
Max Fink, is there anything that can redeem ECT's reputation? No, I don't think
so because it has a blemish that is encrusted And then there's the name itself
It will be fine in 40 years When this present generation is gone There is no way
that you can separate electroconvulsive therapy Shock therapy From a name that
would be less provocative Max Fink, who celebrated his 100th birthday just a few
days after I spoke to him In this programme I've been trying to solve the
conflict in my own mind Between what I thought I knew about ECT and the reality
I wonder whether the fact we don't definitively know how it works Has a big part
to play in why we're so scared of it Perhaps its reputation can't be salvaged
And it doesn't work for everybody But it does for people like Sue, maybe my
Auntie Joyce And certainly Tanya What is your favourite part of the programme? I
did a six mile route, which is the longest run I've done in a while And I was
looking ahead of me at the trees and at the sky Enjoying the feeling of space
and freedom and power and strength It felt like me in a way, which things just
haven't done for so long That's something which is quite incredible Shocking was
presented by Professor Sally Marlow and produced by Fiona Hill Details of

the media in reporting missing person cases? But first with a look ahead to the
Duel tonight, Razia Iqbal Our thanks on the programme tonight, Russia's
President has had a busy day Hailing Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine,
saying they were defending the fatherland And also cementing a diplomatic
relationship the rest of the world is worried about with China We'll find out
why strengthened ties between Moscow and Beijing is concerning to the West And
how exactly China is supporting Russia Also we'll learn what recommendations
from the football fan-led review have made it into the white paper on football
governance And who's likely to drink and like olive oil in their cappuccino
Starbucks thinks the Italians will, do join me in half an hour Razia, thank you
And now on Radio 4, here's Katie Razzle with the Media Show Today, what does the
tragic story of Nicola Bully tell us about the media? Yesterday the broadcast
regulator Ofcom wrote to ITV and Sky News After the Bully family issued damning
criticism of them This afternoon the Police and Crime Commissioner for
Lancashire launched an independent review That will look at the police's
investigation as well as their interaction with the media I'll be talking to a
journalist who's been covering the case And getting the perspective of a former
police chief constable We're also taking a look at the conflict in Ukraine one
year on And asking how it's changed journalism I'm joined by journalists in the
studio and also in Ukraine Amongst them, the BBC's Orla Gerin Hello Orla, where
are you? Tell us where you are right now Hi Katie, we're in the east in a small
town called Drushkivka And that's about half an hour from the city of Bakhmut
Which people will have been hearing about in the headlines in recent weeks and
months It's the centre of a fierce battle now between the Ukrainians and the
Russians Well, very much welcome and thank you so much for sparing us the time
on the Media Show And also with me is Rohit Khatri from ITV News John Sweeney
and Kateryna Malafeeva And more from you all in a moment Because I want to take
a look first at the reporting around Nicola Bully's disappearance Let me just
play you a clip of Andrew Snowden Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire
Who was speaking this afternoon It has got very personal, it's got very vitriol
And it has felt that sometimes that certain elements of the media Have been
determined to expose whatever information they can And undermine the police
investigation And I think Ofcom need to look at that And there will be
reflections for policing around how they have handled elements of the
investigation But I think there should be some reflection from the media Around
has their focus always been in all elements of the media On finding Nicola or
creating stories that will simply create that click through to their websites
Well that was Andrew Snowden, Lancashire's Police and Crime Commissioner And I
want to bring in the Guardian's North of England correspondent Josh Halliday and
Andy Trotter, a former Police Chief Constable And you might remember his role
during the 7-7 London bombings When he was a spokesman for the British Transport
Police As part of his role there Welcome to you both, thanks for coming on Andy,
I'd just like to get your reaction first to what the Police and Crime
Commissioner said there I think Andrew Snowden is absolutely right There clearly
must be a review of what happened there Equally I support what he says about the
reflections not only from the police but from the media This clearly didn't go
well from a number of perspectives And one of the things I think we should be
looking at is how can we make sure this doesn't happen again I say that more in
some hope Because if we go back over various events in the past few years We've
seen this sort of thing happen in the past It's made much worse now by TikTok,
by social media etc But we've seen this sort of thing with the investigation of
the murder of Joanna Yates, of Millie Dowler We've seen the media descend on the
scene and cause lots and lots of issues Having said that, when I was working for
the media relations on behalf of the Chief Police Officers We did have debriefs
with the media afterwards to find out what happened How can we make it better
next time And I think we've all got to look at how we can improve those
relationships Look at each other's needs and try and ensure that we plan for the
next big event That we don't see what we saw up in Lancashire And Josh Halliday,
you covered the story at the beginning and again at the end for The Guardian
What's your take? Well I think Andy's absolutely right about what he says I
think there'll be lessons to be learned from a lot of organisations From this
case, the police will be conducting an internal review of how they handled it
There'll be a fair few external reviews of the police's handling of it as well I
know that it's prompted quite a bit of soul searching internally in media
organisations as well Just in the past couple of days about how we deal with
families in the middle of these extraordinarily traumatic events We do have
codes of conduct and guidelines that the vast majority of journalists adhere to
But we're living in a world now where this isn't like five years ago or ten
years ago Where there was social media, the social media element, but it's hyper
fast now, it's hyper accelerated The advent of TikTok has again changed things
from just a couple of years ago I think this was an extraordinarily difficult
case for the police to deal with from a number of different perspectives and
reasons But I think there will be lessons to be learned from a quite wide
ranging number of organisations And in terms of how you and your colleagues at
The Guardian approach the story I mean in terms of the ethics around it, whether
you would approach the family for comment without being intrusive How do you do
that sort of thing? Did you do that sort of thing? The starting point for us
always is what the police guidance is on whether families wish to speak And
usually the police will tell you that a family doesn't wish to talk If that's
the case, we'd almost certainly stay away and not contact the family, respect
their privacy But there have been cases where the police have told the media
that a family doesn't want to talk And it's turned out not to be right, the
family were keen to talk And that comes down to a kind of breakdown in the
relationship between the press and the police That's kind of happened over the
last ten years that we might come onto a little bit later But in each case we
will use our discretion, guided always by our codes of conduct and our own
individual moral compass as well A lot of the time at The Guardian we're quite
fortunate that there's not this huge pressure to be the first knock at door Or
the first to get this exclusive interview We handle things a little bit more
judiciously and sensitively and hope that in the end our readers value that And
I think that's personally the right way to go about these things And Andy,
Joshua, I do want to come onto what Josh raised there, the relationship between
the press, the media and the police But can I just get your perspective
specifically when it comes to the family complaint about Sky and ITV News That
they'd approached them after the discovery of Nicola's body when they'd asked
for privacy I mean, what's your take on that? Well, clearly I don't know the
facts of what actually happened but we've heard the complaint from the family
And of course Ofcom have a role in this and so we'll see whatever Ofcom have got
to say The investigation of Printmedia is a bit different I mean, The Guardian
is a very responsible newspaper There are others who are not, who don't conform
to those sorts of codes of conduct And as I say, we've seen this on a number of
occasions before So let's hope there's some mature reflections on this so that
we can really start to work together to see how we ought to do this Because this
is clearly going to happen again and none of us want to see what happened
repeated on a future event Yeah, I mean it's worth saying that ITV have said as
a responsible broadcaster We'll cooperate fully and respond in detail to Ofcom's
request for information And they expressed sincere condolences to the family And
they said they wouldn't be commenting further and Sky News told us that they
send their deepest condolences To the family of Nicola Bulli at this difficult
time And they confirmed they'd received Ofcom's letter and they're going to work
closely with them to answer the questions Now, Andy, in terms of what Josh was
just raising there Do you think the changes made, you know, people have been
saying the changes made after the Leveson inquiry Have had a chilling effect on
relations between the police and the media And in fact Andrew Snowden, the
Police and Crime Commissioner said this afternoon He referenced Leveson, he said
there was a potential disconnect between the police and the media I wonder what
you think about that Yes, to some extent that's true I think we should be
careful of not painting some golden image of what happened pre-Leveson I mean
one of the reasons Leveson was brought in was because of corrupt relationships
Between some police officers and the media And quite clearly there were some
major problems, particularly in London at that time There were also very good
relationships, and certainly I was in the Met at the time Between ourselves and
the Crime Reporters Association And we would talk regularly to them, on and off
the record Because they were trusted people that we could discuss background
with Appropriately and properly, so that they were clear about what the issues
were Do you pick up that that's changed now? Do you pick up that actually the
police are more cautious about speaking? Yes, they're a lot more cautious And
the guidance that came out from Leveson was tougher I wrote the national
guidance for the police after Leveson Which does encourage the police to talk
with the media It's worth a read, it's available online And I do want the police
to talk to the media But it must be on the record, from named sources Saving
very exceptional circumstances if there's a legitimate reason for some
background briefing Because we were dealing with some unfortunate relationships
that shouldn't have happened But I think we've lost the good things We've lost
the fact that the police and the media did talk a lot more to each other There's
a lot more understanding Clearly a lot of those journalists have moved on And
clearly a lot of people have moved into this space, calling themselves
journalists So we've got to be very cautious about how we do this So we don't
exclude other people But I do think things could have been a lot better on a
number of cases of late If there had been a better relationship between the
police and the media The media have a job to do It helps the investigation And
they have a role on behalf of the public to oversee what the police are doing
It's vital that relationship is healthy and open And I would like to see it
improve And Josh Halliday, you were nodding there Andy was talking about on-the-
record briefings being important But are off-the-record background briefings
also important to get from the police In order to inform how you do your
reporting Even if you're not reporting what they say It actually informs the way
you frame something Yeah, these are absolutely crucial to help the media Both
understand the context of a story before anything is published To understand how
to frame the story And three, also guide our approach to contacting people who
might be involved in the story But from my experience, and this is over the last
decade But increasingly in recent years It's almost impossible to speak to press
officers these days Because you'll pick up the phone and they'll say That's
great, they'll hear you out And then they'll say, can you put that in an email?
And that's the end of the conversation There isn't that kind of grown-up adult
off-the-record or background conversation That can really help And help the
police as well as help the media Another interesting thing Andy was saying there
Is that the College of Policing actually has media guidance for police forces
And I was reading it yesterday actually for the first time It's incredibly
sensible It encourages police forces to have this open and transparent dialogue
with the media And speak to journalists on a background, non-attributable basis
Or give them information that's not for use but can help them understand a story
But it just doesn't happen And I don't know whether this is because this kind of
culture isn't accepted by senior management in some police forces I spoke to a
friend who recently worked in a large police force yesterday Who said that the
difficulty is getting senior management on board And what benefit there is of
speaking to the media about a lot of investigations It sounds like the guidance
is actually in the right place And people's complaints about Leveson potentially
are wrong It's more at the next level, the individual police force level that
it's a problem And I have to say thank you to you both for coming on But I
wanted to bring in Rohit Khatru here Because you're sitting in the studio and
ICV have been singled out I know you haven't been involved in the coverage at
all of course But I just wonder what your take was Well I mean, people were
talking about it in the newsroom I mean obviously it feels uncomfortable but
everyone was very sad Everyone was really thinking about the family after the
grief they've gone through And we're aware that Ofcom and our own managers are
looking at the details of what happened I don't know what happened but it's very
clear that everyone I know at ITV News Their thoughts are with the family Well
you're staying with us of course because we're now going on to talk about
Ukraine The conflict there is back in the news as the one year anniversary of
Russia's full scale invasion approaches And with me to assess how Ukraine has
changed, war reporting, are of course Rohit Khatru who was speaking to just
then, global security editor at ITV News Who has a film called Ukraine one year
on coming out tomorrow, Thursday on ITV We've also got John Sweeney, an
independent journalist who's been reporting from Ukraine since the start of the
war And Kateryna Malafieva, freelance journalist and producer And as you heard
at the top of the programme, Orla Gherin, senior international correspondent at
BBC News And Orla, if I could start with you, you know you've covered conflicts
all over the world What unique challenges has the Ukraine war specifically posed
do you think? I mean I would say nothing compares to this, both in terms of the
scale and the implications and the challenges We were here last year in the east
at this time, just before the invasion happened And we were expecting it,
although I have to say it was on a bigger scale than I had imagined I thought
President Putin would invade in the east and focus on that But in fact he came
in from three sides One of the biggest difficulties here is the size of this
country It is absolutely vast, just western Ukraine on its own is almost as big
as Germany So you spend a lot of time on the roads, on very bad roads often You
work at this time of year in very severe cold We spent a night last week with a
tank unit quite close to a front line And we were filming at about five in the
morning and it was minus 15 So that presents difficulties for the equipment but
actually also for the people And I think there is another issue which we felt in
our team this week We've been working with local Ukrainian producers since the
beginning of the war And with a very wonderful Ukrainian driver And it's not a
stretch to say we're sort of a family here at the moment And it's very tough to
see the impact on our Ukrainian colleagues I mean it's tough for us to see the
destruction and the loss of life The absolutely needless loss of life But it is
far harder for those who are from this country And we were filming the other day
in a burnt out town, bombed out Just one of many destroyed towns on Ukraine's
long front line And that was actually the hometown of our driver And he came in
with us that morning He hoped to go and see his apartment, the ruins of his
apartment He knows it's destroyed But when we were doing our filming the
situation got a little bit too insecure And we had to leave and he couldn't go
back But he had come in clutching the keys in his hand So I think for all of us,
and I'm sure all of the journalists, John And everybody else would say the same
You get very emotionally connected with this story And you end up going back to
towns time and again And they look worse every time And I'd like to bring in
Kateryna Malifieva Because you are in a sense exactly what Ola is talking about
You're a Ukrainian freelance journalist, you're in Kiev at the moment How do you
fulfil that dual role of living in and reporting on the war? Particularly I
think you have suffered a really awful loss yourself Well indeed it's been quite
a hard year And at the beginning of the invasion I sort of felt that I was
prepared for this Simply because I was covering the conflict in Donbass since
2014 I mentioned before that I'm originally from Donetsk And I've been working
almost non-stop for these nine years I can definitely tell you the difference
Because I also tried myself before as a foreign journalist And I reported in
other conflicts like Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan And I can feel the
difference within myself That when you report on a conflict, in a different
conflict You don't feel that attached as you are right now And as Ola was
saying, I've also been working quite extensively in the East I've also just
returned from Chasipyar and from Drushkivka And there are enormous conditions of
working Like in minus 10, minus 15 And it's hard because when you come back to
Kiev Where I stayed at best two months in the past year You cannot completely
relax or recuperate Because every time when I come back to Kiev There is either
a missile attack or a blackout And my life is also affected by this as well And
also indeed, I think you're like, sorry to interrupt But I think you're also,
you know, you're suffering your own grief too Is that right, that your mother
was killed in the conflict? My mom died in Donetsk on the 16th of March last
year And I was not able to attend the funeral Because, you know, because of the
war And my father is still there So I was not at the funeral, I was not able to
say her final goodbye And what is more, it was one of the horrible situations
Because there were no people who were even able to dig a grave Because at that
time Russia started recruiting local population Who are officially Ukrainians,
you know Maybe just holding or possessing Russian passports Because of the
necessity for their life survival You know, like there were no men forced to do
that So indeed, I would say that You know, when you think about this conflict
And you think that, I can't imagine anything harder But every time I speak to
people, like I spoke to a girl today in Bucha Whose father got missing, who
survived the occupation 17 years old girl And I was thinking, there is no day
when I wouldn't be wondering Or grieving together with these people Because it's
just simply shocking testimonies of the civilians Who suffered this war I mean,
Rohit, you were here in the studio, you were nodding What's the war been like
from your perspective? Well, as Ola says, it's really the scale of it And when
you think of Katarina's, you know, heartbreaking story What you then have to do
is multiply that millions of times To get a sense of what is happening in
Ukraine I think for many of us covering it What was so shocking was watching
this develop at first Me and I think John and Ola as well were there before the
invasion And there was still uncertainty about what would happen You know, a lot
of people seem to be in denial when we're out there And then on the 24th of
February, you know, it began And everyone's sort of worst thoughts, their
emergency plans Kicked into high gear But, you know, we've been doing long
stints out there Sometimes six or seven weeks in one go And when you cover this
story and when you return Perhaps half a dozen times over the course of a year
You know, the people that you know, the people that you work with But also the
people who you are reporting on, who you return to You know, you become
incredibly close to them And you become very invested in their stories You are
just an outsider And there are tens of millions of Ukrainians Who are suffering
many, many times worse than me or Ola or John Let me bring in John Sweeney
Because I think, John, you've been there Certainly for a very long period, if
not the whole time And unlike Rohit or Ola, you're actually flying solo You're
crowdfunding your reporting Yes I think, so I first went to the wars in Rwanda,
Burundi in 1988 And then I've been to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Angola, bits of
Cambodia Presumably you weren't crowdfunding any of those trips So this is
different No, no, no, no, I was looking for the Observer and the BBC But this
time, the thing that's very striking about this war Is it really is good versus
evil It feels like, when I read about the Second World War It felt like to be in
Kiev a year ago It felt exactly like what I read Stories of Malcolm Muggeridge
and Graham Greene Wandering around Soho during the Blitz Laughing at the Nazi
bombers because there was nothing else you could do And this real, real sense
And this is why this is a very different war Because this war, Vladimir Putin
has ripped up the 1945 settlement And this is a war of an innocent and peaceful
democracy Invaded by a fascist dictatorship It's interesting, isn't it, because
there is, of course, no pretense of impartiality in your reporting You make
clear your opposition to Vladimir Putin It's interesting, we've had people on
the programme before John Simpson, for example, who talked about there being a
deficit of impartiality When it comes to this war I disagree with my great and
good friend and old war horse, John Simpson Because due impartiality, which is a
very BBC concept Essentially means fairness But it's perfectly proper And I
don't think that I've ever, ever crossed the line on this That I have always
been fair to the Russian army and the Ukrainian army And the Russian army kills
children And the Ukrainian army tries not to It tries to kill Russian soldiers
who shouldn't be here So the single most striking thing about this war Is the
fact that it is a war of good versus evil Let me just interrupt you for a second
Because I would like to bring in Olga Gerind from the BBC at this point Is that
how you see it? Do you approach it as a war, as a conflict between good and
evil? I approach it by reporting what we see on the ground I think there is a
difference between reporting and taking a position We may all have our private
views on this And they are private We're not here to advocate We are here to
simply say what we see In saying that, what we see is devastating enough And I
think it leads to very clear conclusions And I think you have to be factual in
your reporting But you also have to bring your judgement And your common sense
to bear So for example, in the first few weeks and possibly months of the war We
were continuing to say in our reporting Russia denies that it targets civilians
Well, at a certain point that became not just redundant but ridiculous Because
we were seeing every single day the evidence of our own eyes That Russia was
targeting civilians So I don't think you have to parrot the Russian position
every time When you know that the evidence is stacked up so high That it's doing
the opposite But that said, I think it's important to try and bring An
understanding of the perspective in Russia And one of the things that I think
has added immeasurably to our coverage over the year Has been the amazing work
of my colleague Steve Rosenberg in Moscow Yes, but he raised it on the other
side Yeah, but he has brought us an insight not just into Putin and his circle
But also into the feeling of ordinary Russians Some of whom back the war Some of
whom are silent, some of whom don't So I think you try and get balance in that
sense But I don't think it's for us here on the ground in Ukraine To be trying
to give some sort of unreal balance about what the Russians are doing We say
what we see and what we see is devastating And the evidence is there every
single day Yeah, you know, accuracy and balance aren't necessarily the same
thing And the whole point of us being there The whole point of us spending these
long stints there Is to find out on behalf of our viewers what is happening We
don't need to caveat that by saying, well the other side say this If what we're
seeing in front of us is so emphatically clear And so often it was in so many
towns, you know, right across the country And Katarina, just in terms of the
kind of access you're able to get How easy is it for you to, for example, get
access to President Zelensky Or other senior figures in the government? That's a
good question because I would rather say that The office of the President of
Ukraine has a full monopoly On certain permissions and access So basically there
is a ban on the interviews with the commander-in-chief With Valery Zeluzhny,
because the only way to get access And have an interview with him is to ask
permission of the President This is something that you won't hear It's getting
also higher to report in certain areas Like, it was quite difficult to report in
Kherson initially when it was liberated So those journalists who managed to get
into Kherson on the second day after liberation Like myself, they were stripped
of their accreditations But then later on returned, simply because they were
before the President as well And with regards to reporting in Donbass It's hard
to arrange the access to artillery or whatsoever Because there are hundreds of
journalists Right now there are about 186 journalists, according to my
information Who are reporting, and there are like several brigades And several
press officers who can facilitate the access So it's very, very hard Very
quickly, John, access, how does that work? I know quite a few friends in the
Ukrainian army So I've had a fair bit of access I was at Zelensky's press
conference Another thing we haven't looked at is, for example The role of people
like Tucker Carlson Who says that Ukraine is neo-Nazi And it's a waste of time
supporting Ukraine He's the single most watched US cable TV host And he's
talking dark nonsense So there is a problem in all of the good reporting that
flows from this There is a kind of wider information war Which the Russian side
fight incredibly darkly and dishonestly And I feel we've got to fight that too
And that is a moment where we're going to have to end the show, unfortunately
Because we have run out of time Thanks for watching!
