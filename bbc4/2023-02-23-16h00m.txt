 here on Radio 4 or you can hear the whole series now on BBC Sounds. say their
primary focus is the dissident Republican group known as the New IRA. Reverend
Graham Hare, the rector of the nearby St. Columbus Church, says the attack has
shaken the community. The tragedy here is that here we have a public servant, a
man who put his life on the line day and daily in the pursuit of justice and the
pursuit of peace. And here he was serving his community as a football coach
alongside his son and friends. And it's in that environment that these evil
cowards choose to come and gun them down. New data shows the number of asylum
seekers waiting for a decision on their case in the UK has soared to record
levels, with around 166,000 people in the backlog. Yesterday, the Home Office
announced plans to streamline applications from certain countries by replacing
interviews with a 10-page questionnaire. Sir Keir Starmer has set out plans for
five national missions should Labour win the next general election, including
making the economy the fastest growing among the G7. The other four would be
reducing health inequalities, tackling crime, making the UK a clean energy
superpower and raising education standards. But critics say his speech didn't
contain enough detail on policy. The Sports Minister, Stuart Andrew, has paid
tribute to the football commentator John Motsen, who has died at the age of 77.
Mr Andrew told the House of Commons he'd had an incredible impact over his 50
years working at the BBC. His family have said he died peacefully in his sleep.
The Oscars will introduce what it calls a crisis team to handle any real-time
incidents this year. In response to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage
during last year's ceremony, the chief executive of the Academy says the new
unit hopes to be ready for anything. BBC News. We'll be taking a walk in the
Brecon Beacons in just a moment for a rather romantic edition of Ramblings. But
first, a quick look at some new drama. On BBC iPlayer. Six robbers have carried
out an armed raid, stealing almost three tonnes of gold. Inspired by Britain's
biggest gold heist. How do you shift three tonnes of gold? Slowly. 26 million
pounds worth of pure gold in the possession of people who didn't expect to have
it. If you do a job like this, you're not a murderer. You only hear about the
people who get caught. Stealing it was just the start. We're looking for six
robbers and three tonnes of gold. Every ring, every watch. If you're looking for
the gold, it's all around you. The Gold Watch on BBC iPlayer. Now on Radio 4,
let's join Claire Balding in South Wales for Ramblings. It is a glorious
winter's day. Honestly, the best day that we have had for this series. I love
doing the winter series because hardly anyone's around. And if you get a day
like this, it feels magical. And even if you come to a really popular spot, and
I have done today, I'm in Waterfall Country in the Brecon Beacons, just north of
Merthyr Tydfil. It's fresh, but it's not too cold. There's barely any wind. The
birds are singing. The trees are completely silhouetted against a blue sky.
Leaves not yet apparent. And it just feels fresh and invigorating. And Roger and
Sam are with me. And this really is a love story as much as it is a walk. But
this place is special and we haven't even got to the good bit yet. No, we
haven't. Not yet. Yeah, this is one of our favourite places to be. We do it
quite regularly, don't we? It's the first place we ever met, wasn't it? It is.
Yeah, it is. But it's just something about it. We do a lot of cold water
swimming as well. So there's always nice little private areas that you can find.
You have the main waterfalls, of course, but we go off the beaten track
sometimes and we always find a nice little private spot. Little secluded spots,
aren't they? Yeah. Well, the Brecon Beacons is vast. It's 520 square miles.
There's something like 1,200 miles of walking routes. But I know that in the
summer, this spot becomes almost unbearably busy. So I'd really recommend
visiting it off peak. Yes, definitely. 100% that's the best times to do it.
Definitely. But whenever you can, it's always different. It always looks
different. You always get a different perspective and you always leave feeling
really grateful. But that's how I feel anyway. You said this is where you first
met. How? So we're part of a walking group on Facebook. That's actually how we
met. She asked for the postcode for free parking. It was here. It was here,
yeah. So we decided to meet up for a walk just as like-minded people, weren't
we? Yeah, definitely. We were just into the same things. So we decided that we
would meet up as friends initially. Well, that's all I want. That's all we
wanted. And so, yeah, we met up here and went for a walk. We decided that we
would do a dip as well. And that was November, November 2021. So yeah, it was
quite cold, but we took one of those Swedish candles. Swedish candles. What's
that then? It's basically like a block of wood. But it's got almost like a
natural fire lighter inside. So they burn outwards. So it just gives you warmth,
really. Yeah, you brought it along and I was a bit like you. What's that? But
since we've used it quite a few times and it's very handy when you come out the
water just to warm up. But yeah, so we met here and we started chatting. We
talked a lot. We've got so much in common. And we just carried on doing our
little meetups. But it was quite funny because the time that we decided that it
could possibly be a bit more than friendship and we thought it was going to be a
date now, we decided to meet. Have you heard of the diving board? It's near Pen
Y Fan. But it's got a thing called the diving board on it. It was just a rock
that outfaces so you can like stand on it and look over. Just look out through
the valley. It's an amazing view. What happens then at the diving board? Is
there a first date? We actually met on different mountains because I thought the
diving board was somewhere else. So we did our own individual walk. We did our
usual solo walk. So I rang her a few times. She was like, no, I'm definitely
here. I'm like, you're not because I am. Yeah, so what was that? An hour and a
half, I reckon. We had our own solo walks. We did, yeah. And then we met up
after. I quite enjoyed it. It was a nice walk. We eventually met at the bottom
in between the two at the cafe. We're heading steeply downhill into the woods
and you can hear in the distance the rush of one of the four waterfalls because
this is known as the four waterfalls walk. And there's a circular route. I want
to say circle. It goes off around and bends and stuff like that. But it's a
pretty easy walk to do. I wouldn't say it was hard. Yeah, so it's nice because
it's got quite easy paths. They're wide. They're not particularly treacherous.
You know, there's some bits that are steep. The steepest parts and the most
challenging parts are the steps down to the falls and coming back up them. You
need good leg muscles for them because they are quite steep. And this is not
somewhere you would go for a swim, is it? We have dipped in the four falls. Oh,
OK. Is that what you're planning to do that today? No, no. You're all good. Not
today. Do you know there's a science to why the air around waterfalls is good
for us? And it's to do with negative ions. And negative ions are a good thing.
OK, so even way back, someone like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the poet who
suffered from really bad depression, he found walking in and around waterfalls
to be particularly beneficial. And it genuinely is because the air is broken up
by the water and it changes the nature of the air around you. So if you're here
for a good half hour, it will have a massively positive effect. I know that it
has an effect with meditation. So you can look into a waterfall and not get
hypnotized, but almost, you know, get into a meditative state. It's very
calming. It's a very calming experience. And you've zoned out with everything
that's around you and you're just focusing on being present in the moment. It's
the best time, you know. Did you want to go and have a look down by here? Yeah,
I'd love to. From this angle, we can see the water dropping down hugely steeply,
ledges of rock. And there is an upturned tree, the whole of it, roots heading up
the waterfall that is right in the middle that's been washed down there. But
that first drop must be 12, maybe 15 feet. And then the next one, more like 16,
17. I think as well as the scientific side of it, of the air being different
because the water changing the molecules, it's the presence of that force and
that natural force of water, I think that makes you feel different inside. Yes.
So for me, it kind of makes me realize just how small I am in the world and how
much natural beauties are around me that I think a lot of people take for
granted, you know, me included. We've paused at this spot, having just come over
the bridge, because the stream turns and is about to head towards the waterfall
and start its first major descent. But here it's just beautifully, it's moving
obviously, but it's not rushing, it's not frantic. It's really quite clear as
well today. Yeah. In the summer, this is where a lot of people come to just play
about really. It's a good place for children because it's quite shallow. And
actually, I know there have been issues around here. And again, be careful, just
be careful. Respect the water as well. Yeah, and you know, you have to think
about as much as obviously when there's been heavy rainfall and that's when the
waterfalls look their most magnificent, you know, but it can be so dangerous, so
slippery. Every time you come out to places like this, you have to be aware that
there's going to be a risk. You know, you are going to take a risk every time.
There are freak accidents and tragedies that happen. And there are a lot of
boards up warning on the safety side of things. But I mean, it is open. They've
got signs, but if you are going to go against those signs, then... It's your
risk, isn't it? Yeah, there's only so much people can do. And also there's
always that balance between wanting places to stay unspoilt. So you don't want
signs and fences and cordoned off areas. The beauty of it is it's the fact that
it is natural. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So we're going to head up these steps,
the path gets much narrower here, so we're going single file. And just because
of the time of year, what's lovely about this is being able to constantly look
up towards the sky and being able to see right through the branches of the
trees. And Roger, were you, had you always been an outdoorsy kind of chap? What
was your childhood like? I used to get made to go on walks when I was a kid by
my parents, which obviously is stuck with me. I'm happy as long as like the
walk's a good walk, really. As long as it's not destroyed and mankind haven't
taken them completely over it, then I'm happy with any walk, really. We haven't
really got a plan, have we? No, just do whatever comes to mind, really, in the
end of the time. We've got a time limit with the school run, which usually we go
on our walks when the children are in school. And what age are the kids now? So
I've got a six-year-old and an eight-year-old. And Roger, your kids are? Seven
and ten. Oh gosh. So they're all similar ages. Yeah. They all get on, so that's
a lot of boys for me. Is it four boys? Four boys. Wow. But isn't that funny?
With all the dating apps and the different ways in which you might have met, and
actually both having two kids the same age, would have been a common factor. But
actually what did it was just both happening to be in a walking group. Yeah,
that's it, isn't it? It's a natural way of progressing. Well, that's the thing.
We weren't looking to be in any kind of relationship at all at the time that we
met. And it was purely based on friendship at the start. It was. It was just
concentrating on our self-care and not others around us, really. I think it's
helpful when you've got less pressure. You know, when you go on a dating app and
you're expecting to date, and there's expectations, and there was none of that
with us. So it was just enjoying each other's company and getting to know one
another in the most natural surroundings that we could find. You're listening to
Ramblings on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, and today I'm in the Brecon Beacons walking
the Four Waterfalls Walk with Samantha Chapman and Roger Taylor. And we've been
discussing how the two of you met here. You know, they say when you know, you
know. But it is like that. It is an actual thing, yeah. When you know, you do
know. Because we didn't think it would ever happen, really, did we? No. It's how
similar we are. We are literally the same person in female and male form. I just
didn't realise that a relationship could flow so easily, you know? I think as
you get older and you've gone through different things in your life, and you
kind of just expect certain things to be a certain way, and you accept them. And
you're like, well, yeah, it's bound to be like that because I'm, you know, the
age I am and there's been a running theme all my life. But it was completely
different. Completely different. It was effortless. You go through lessons,
don't you, in previous relationships to then find what you actually want and
what you deserve, really, more than anything. And I think you learn a lot about
yourself as well. And actually, knowing what makes you stressed and avoiding it
is a really important part of life. And knowing what makes you happy. And how
wonderful that actually it is something that's free, that's accessible, that you
can fit into daily life. It's physically and mentally good for you. And that you
share it. Yeah, we do it together. Yeah. And we're fortunate enough that our
work schedules allow it. What do you do? I'm a dental nurse, but I'm part-time
because obviously I've got the children. So I have Mondays and Tuesdays off,
which is lovely. And I run a handyman company and I work for Tesco in the
evenings, but I have Mondays off. So we always got time. We always got time to
do stuff. And we do something that we enjoy. Yeah. Without children. Yeah. I
just love the feel of this place. You know, the peacefulness of it. And then you
get the raging of a waterfall. So that sort of force hits you. There's so many
different aspects to this walk. And also I think I had, because of the walking
I've done in the Brecon Beacons before, has been up onto high ridges, very bare,
you know, open land. Yeah. So I'm not sure I'd appreciated that there are pretty
woodland walks that you can do that are this gorgeous. There's so many to choose
from here. There's so many. And they're all quite close to one another. So
there's so many to choose from around here. So you've got engaged now. Yes. And
is there a plan? Do you have to say that's wedding day is then? Oh, it's all
booked. Oh, is it? We booked the wedding day, yes. Is it? When is it? August
2024. Oh, wow. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. How many of the group that were
at your original meeting and that walking group, are you friends with those
people or was that sort of... No. No? Nobody? So this really was the most
extraordinary coincidence? Yeah, yeah. We didn't know anyone that she knows.
That you were both... Nothing like that. Don't know anyone. Literally, just
complete solo walkers. Out of the chance, yeah. Added myself to the group
because I wanted to have ideas where to go next. I posted, everybody posted
their pictures and Roger commented on it. And yeah, just completely by chance.
So I don't know anybody else in the group. The group is a very big group though.
It's a very large space. There's what, 10,000 people in there or more? No,
there's more than that. Oh, is it more? And what's it called then? Walking in
Wales. Walking in Wales Facebook group is a very good group. And they're all
very communal, aren't they? Everyone's very nice. They'll comment on your
picture, nice stuff. Yeah, so I felt the need to, when we did get engaged, just
do a little post to thank the group for existing and bringing this man into my
life. And it just went a bit viral after that with over 9,000 likes. I wasn't
expecting. But just to make it absolutely clear, they still won't get invited to
the wedding. Yeah, I ain't gonna mind to invite that many people. Lovely as that
is. I love all these branches, all these roots. I've always loved this little
section. Oh, there, where it sort of looks like interwoven fingers and toes of
the trees, linked like hands. I just see it as like a timeline, you know, of how
long it's all been here and how expansive it is. And yeah, I just, I always love
this little bit. The colour of today as well is that burnt orange of leaves that
are still left, but also the bracken over there on the far side. It's by far my
most favourite colour. It's our colour for the wedding, isn't it? Yeah. It just
reminds me of being outside and as much as I like it when it's green and it's,
you know, spring and summertime, but yeah, autumn, winter, colour-wise. Yeah. We
incorporate everything into nature, don't we? Even like the engagement ring,
we've made that nature vibe. I did that, yeah. That's me, everyone, me. Yeah,
now that was based on nature, isn't it? Yeah. And leaves and things like that.
Are you wearing it under the gloves? Yeah. Can I have a look? Oh gosh, that's
absolutely beautiful. It's a teardrop diamond in the middle and green. Savoy it
is. Oh, how lovely. As you say, the leaves on either side. Yeah. Of a central,
so more than a teardrop, more like a seed in a way. Yeah, in a way, yeah. Or the
centre of a. The centre of a. Yeah, the aim is to be like her in the middle and
then like the leaves sprouting off her really, like as in a nature vibe. So that
was the plan. That's because I'm awesome. That's what you did. I'll be in that
awesome love. It's OK. How lucky are you? I know, I know. Keep talking about it.
Yeah, I mean, I was blown away by the ring. I just, what more could you want
when it's completely tailored to you? It's designed about everything that is
you. The engagement happened on a walk and was that with the full production of
Ring and Down On One Knee. He proposed though and showed me the ring and then
was like, oh, let's go in the water. And all I wanted to do was put the ring on.
So I was in the water going, I want to get out now. I didn't really enjoy the
dip that day. So, Roger, where did you, where did you grow up? Redden, well,
Wokenham to be exact. Just outside of Redden. I know it well. And what brought
you to Cardiff? So my mum is Welsh, so she moved down here and then I decided to
follow, really. And then bought my own house and, well, I love it here. I'm
within an hour of anything I want to go to, really, no matter what. So I could
go to a beach one day and then go on a long hike the next, really. This Robin
has been following us. He does it every time we're here. Yeah, and every time we
sort of get to a wider, it just checks in, pops down onto a branch, goes, yeah,
I'm still with you. We call it our pet, honestly, every time we come. Every
walk, that Robin's there. And convinces the same one. Every single walk, we've
never not had that Robin. That one will get an invitation to a wedding. He'll
just turn up anywhere, eh? Yeah, exactly. Like it or not. You can hear the
waterfall, just the rumble in the distance. We're going to head down to the
waterfalls now, but these are the ones that you can walk behind. And how do you
say that? Skwyd. Skwyd yr. I'd say yr. Yr. But my Welsh isn't great. So it's
spelled S-G-W-D, new word Y-R, new word E-I-R-A. So we've got 170 steps down
this path. Some of them are steeper than others. It's worth coming back up it.
They're not all even. It's okay going down. Yeah, yeah. We've come all the way
down those 170 steps and now staring at the waterfall that's gushing over in
three distinct channels. And there is a path that goes behind it. And I've just
seen a man walk from the other side and I talked to two women. And it is a case
always of just checking it's safe. I've done it many times. Something you don't
forget. I couldn't allow you both to come here and not do it. Oh, this is
fabulous. Water's falling right in front of us now. And we're into the cliff
face. That was magnificent getting right in behind it. So we've come out the
other side and we're going to head back through and go back up those 170 steps.
And do you know the strangest thing of all? When we came through the waterfall,
who was waiting for us on a branch the other side? Our little Robin. And I can
see him over the other side going, are you coming back now? He'll be right with
you all the way. That was so good. You have to scramble a fair bit over the
rocks to get to the path that is behind the waterfall. Exactly as you said, so
worth it. And you feel like you've been doused in magic water. And we're not
even wet. I mean, I should point out. You don't go in there to get wet.
Literally just the mist from the falls. Surprising how much room is behind the
falls. Because when you look at it head on, you don't think that you can even
get behind it. And also an appreciation for the solidity of those red sandstone
rocks. And the way that that water has carved through them. And then, you know,
hit a point where the drop is the only thing that can be done. I think it's
quite a romantic spot as well. We've seen lots of couples going in behind there
and having a quick kiss. I was unfortunately ruining that moment for you. I've
got a wet beard, she wouldn't have done it anyway. Right, we've got to climb
back up those steps now. Big heart pumping. Yeah. Oh, hello. There he is. Hello
little Robin. He's following us. Come on. Isn't that funny? I've never had that
before. Because when I saw him again up here, I thought, oh, that's a different
one. Now I absolutely know it's the same one. Yeah. Every time we come here,
isn't it? Every single time. You sit on the rock when we're having our dip and
wait. Well, it's quite hard work in the end. I'd put that walk in the
challenging basket. But so worth it. I feel renewed. And it must keep having
that effect, because you've done that lots of times. You're still glowing. Yeah,
it literally brings a smile to my face every time. There's never a time you have
a bad trip here. Yeah, it's always a nice walk, isn't it? It's magical. Just
brilliant to share this walk with you and to hear about your love story. And
good luck with the wedding. Thank you so much. In 2024. Thank you. And bye-bye
to the little Robin, who I think is going to leave us here. Yeah, he'll be back.
If you come back, you'll meet him again. He'll be there. Ramblings is presented

international soloist trumpeter Alison Balsom makes the Radio 4 appeal on behalf
of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. I fell in love with the
trumpet when I was seven. Music was free at my state school in Royston, so
everyone who wanted was able to enjoy it. At 15, I joined the National Youth
Orchestra and was completely immersed in the joy of playing with others. It
changed my life. Working with so many talented young musicians taught me about
different ways to listen, communicate and build relationships. Education
research shows that playing together is key to young people's all-round
development. But chances to do this are diminishing. Budgets are being squeezed
in state schools and local music services, and many families don't have the
money for music lessons. Young people are being locked out of the opportunity to
develop their talents and life skills through music and deprived of the joy it
brings. That's why I'm delighted that the National Youth Orchestra has NYO
Inspire, a free nationwide programme, giving thousands of teenage musicians
every year the chance to learn and play music together. Like Kai, who fell in
love with the violin when she was six. As a teenager in Hastings, there was no
orchestra to help her reach that next level. She was stuck playing her violin in
her bedroom alone. When she first joined NYO Inspire, Kai said she was nervous.
She thought she wasn't good enough. But Kai's musical skills and passion
flourished. She played in this NYO collaboration during lockdown. Kai joined all
the Inspire activities she could and became one of NYO's workshop leaders,
showcasing orchestral music in schools nationally. Kai said she would not have
had the confidence to do this without the National Youth Orchestra. This is what
NYO Inspire does. It offers free musical opportunities across the UK, breaking
down barriers and bringing teenagers together. That's why I'm making this
appeal. You can help thousands of teenagers unlock their potential. A life-
changing day for one young musician costs £127. Any donation can help towards
this. And an incredible group of NYO supporters will match your donations pound
for pound to make every gift go further. You can give now. Just search online
for Radio 4 Appeal or call 0800 404 8144. That's 0800 404 8144. Or you can write
a cheque to the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and send it to free
post BBC Radio 4 Appeal. That's free post BBC Radio 4 Appeal. Please remember to
mark the back of your envelope NYO. Thank you. Alison Boulton. Calls are free
from landlines and mobiles. And you can find all the details for giving online
if you search for BBC Radio 4 Appeal. And if you're a UK taxpayer and you want
the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain to collect the gift aid on your
donation, then please include an email or postal address so that they can send
you a gift aid declaration. Rebecca Knight and James Purefoy star in Gaslight.

Now on Radio 4, here's Open Book with Chris Power. The World and All That It
Holds is a big, bold title for a book and it belongs, fortunately, to a big and
bold novel. Its author, Alexander Hemon, hasn't lived in his native Bosnia since
the siege of Sarajevo, and reading him you know that the world of his books and
all that they hold, chaos, exile and displacement, come straight from the heart.
Opening with the fateful assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 and
zooming across war-torn Eastern Europe, the new Soviet Empire and all the way to
China, this latest offering is no exception. At the heart of this journey,
cheating death, gaining a daughter and getting embroiled with spies, are fellow
Sarajevans Pinto and Osman. When I spoke to Hemon, I began by asking him why he
made these two soldiers not only lovers, but specifically Jewish and Muslim
lovers. Well, I mean, being Jewish and Muslim was not uncommon in Sarajevo at
that time, because the city was small and people interacted a little bit, lived
in different neighbourhoods. Probably they would have encountered each other in
Sarajevo. However, they met in the army, right, where all of those ethnicities
and nationalities were packed together, were not organized along ethnic lines.
It's perfectly plausible and possible that they were sleeping next to each other
in the barracks. As for their being lovers, I sold a book on proposal in 2010 to
my British publisher for some reason. And that proposal, which I read only once
since 2010, they were friends. And the way I wanted to set it up back then was
they would be friends and they would be longing for Sarajevo, and all they
wanted would have been to return to Sarajevo, but they would be moving away from
the city, as is the case in the book now. At some point, I guess I understood
that would set the pitch of the book at the level of nostalgia, maybe
increasing, maybe kind of a flat pitch, and I've written a lot about nostalgia
in my characters and also in my artistic work. So I thought it would be more
interesting if they were lovers. But also I wanted to test the limits of love in
the most unfriendly circumstances, the most difficult circumstances. How can one
love, how can people love each other in a situation where the world is
continuously and repeatedly falling apart? You certainly put them through the
ringer, which I'd like to talk a bit more about later. But Osman himself is so
lovable, I mean to Pinto clearly, but also to many other soldiers in his company
to whom he tells stories and sings songs. And you make him really attractive to
the reader as well. Could you tell us a bit more about him and his background?
Well, I love characters like Osman in real life and in books, these charismatic
storytellers who engage with people around themselves and create a makeshift
community, as it were, that's incredibly valuable in a situation of war or
serving in the military. And he's also a kind of person that, in contrast,
Pinto, who's a reflexive and contemplative, this kind of person that it seemed
to me Pinto would like, that two of them would complement each other. In all of
my work, including their storytelling as a means of engagement and communication
and distributing knowledge, as it were, plays a crucial role. And so very often
there's a storytelling character in my work, and here it's Osman, who tells
lovely stories. I want to talk about language, which is a theme running
throughout the book. Can we hear a passage? This is from Pinto and Osman's time
in Tashkent just after the war. And this shows really how language intertwines
in the book. Ever since he woke up in the hospital and Issaq Abramovitch
welcomed him back into the world, Pinto spoke in Bosnian to him, while the good
doctor spoke back in Russian. From the beginning, they would pick the words from
the other's language and insert them in their sentences, and thus they exchanged
and learned them. Pinto sometimes clandestinely imported Spanish, just as Issaq
Abramovitch smuggled in Yiddish words, while Osman added Arabic words he had
learned in Mosque. Over time, they developed their own pidgin, and they
understood one another. No need for any translation. That extract shows how your
characters blend languages, and the text of the novel itself is a babel of
sorts. It's written in English, but it contains a certain amount of untranslated
Bosnian and German. And most fascinating of all, you mentioned in the passage,
Spaniol. Can you describe that language for people who don't know it? Spaniol is
commonly known as Ladino, it's the derivation or, you know, descendant of the
Castilian Spanish, 15th century Castilian Spanish that the Jews carried along on
their, you know, journeys east after they were expelled from the Iberian
Peninsula. What I read about in this passage, and what really interested me in
the book, is the notion of macaronic language, and it's from macaroni, the
Italian pasta, because it's a kind of language or kind of linguistic discourse
where you hold languages together like a bunch of macaroni. That is commonly
used among immigrants and migrants, unless languages are geographically
isolated, there's always, always a macaronic aspect to it, the overlapping of
languages that creates new language. And this is particularly the case in parts
of the world like Bosnia, there were parts of empires, right, the colonized
places where, you know, there was the language of the empire imposed from top-
down bureaucratic language, and then older grassroots languages, people who use
people in daily interactions, right. And so Sarajevo in that sense was
multilingual at that time, as were many, many cities, certainly in the Ottoman
Empire. And from this, a very rich and beautiful language emerges. You've spoken
before about your uneasiness in writing about the siege of Sarajevo without
living through it. You'd gone to America for a short visit, I think, just before
the siege began, and then you were sort of stranded in America. And it's a
subject you return to again here in the book's epilogue. And of course, you
recreate Pinto and Osman's experience in the trenches. What are the ethics for
you when it comes to writing fiction set during the war time? Well, with the
siege of Sarajevo, there were friends and people who I knew who were, you know,
had that experience to the fullest, unfortunately, right. And they still are
around and alive, and they remember things. And it is not for me to pretend as
though I was there, right. As far as, you know, trench war in 1914, we're all
equally distant from that, right. And the only access to that experience is by
way of someone else's testimony. And none of those people are alive, right. And
so that kind of levels the playing field. I suppose my ethics as a writer is to
respect other people's experience, to try to imagine the experience of trench
warfare in 1916 in Galicia. I need to imagine what it smelled like, right, which
is different from reading books about, you know, tactical positioning, so the
organization of the trenches, the networks of trenches, and, you know, which I
read too. But one has to, I have to imagine a sensory experience, what it felt
like, where, what would be the itchy part of the body, the itchiest part if you
had slept in the trenches for two years. In your book, Nowhere Man, you wrote,
Sarajevo in the 80s was a beautiful place to be young. And in this novel, again,
we get to see Sarajevo just before a war breaks out. It's a constant presence in
the book, although we get to spend very little actual time there. You obviously,
as you've been saying, had a very different experience to what Pinto and Osman
go through. But you must have drawn on your own feelings of absence and longing
when you were describing theirs. Of course. I mean, they're displaced and
they're moving away from their place of origin, from their home, and therefore
from everything that constitutes them or constituted them in Sarajevo, right,
that is interaction with their family and friends, and also social organization
that requires presence of other people like a city. And so this is what I was
talking about earlier, this sort of the idea of nostalgia in which people can
remember their previous life but devoid of all the glitches and problems, right,
so like kind of retroactive utopia. But part of the reason for that nostalgia or
part of that nostalgia is a sense that once upon a time in some other place, I
was a complete person and haven't been complete since. And it is this thing that
they long for in some ways where things would be clear to them and about them.
Pinto has a fantasy of returning to Sarajevo with Osman and showing him the
neighborhood as in this is where I came from. And as they try and get back
there, it's like peristalsis, they're kind of getting, the world is moving them
further away from it. And the world's constantly being remade under their feet,
whether it's the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires at the end
of World War I, or the birth of Soviet Russia or the reshaping of China. You've
written elsewhere of the relentless flow of calamities we call the world. Did it
feel like you were solely looking back when you were writing the book or did
present day events intrude in any way? Well, the present day is a very long day.
So, you know, the war in Bosnia is a central fact of my life and of everyone
else I know in their lives, right, my parents and family and these friends. And
then, of course, we have had very rough past few years with COVID and, you know,
the rise of American fascism. And then the war in Ukraine started, which started
in 2014, and now it escalated further. And so, you know, there are no new things
that happened that made me think, oh, I should add things to this book now,
right? It was all there already for the taking. For many of us whose lives were
changed by a rupture that they had no control over, it is my little theory that
biologically people move toward the space, or it's biologically determined that
people want to move toward a space where they have greater agency, where they
can find food or education for their children or jobs. And they don't always
know where exactly that place is. It's just a distant horizon. And that allowed
me to access Pinto's consciousness. He wants to go somewhere where his daughter,
Raela, will have something to eat and sleep, right? And you keep moving until
you find such a place. There's millions of people doing it right now. So this,
whatever theory of displacement and migration narration I might have, it's come
from my experience and experience of my people. Well, one of those places to
which they're displaced in the latter stages of the book is Shanghai in the
1930s, which you present as this very full-on city of extreme wealth and extreme
poverty. It's awash with refugees and criminals and political agents. You've
taken us there before in your fiction. What's the fascination that it holds for
you? Well, I mean, I love cities in general. Cities as these conglomerates of
destinies and experiences and people and constant tension. In some ways, cities
are not supposed to survive with all these disparate elements, right? There's a
kind of a crypto-fascist logic that monolithic entities last longer, right? So
you have to purify things, the language, the state, the city, protect the
country from more immigrants, right? And in my ethics and aesthetics and
experience, right, the more complicated it is, the more life there is in there.
And there are more people and experiences, which is obviously narratively
stimulating. And while it was not entirely enjoyable to live in Shanghai back in
the day for a lot of people, right, it is the number of stories that came from
Shanghai to me just by reading books about spies and revolutions and history is
enormous. I think because such was the administrative regulation or system in
Shanghai, there was the worst kind of colonialism. I mean, the control of
Shanghai. I don't want to teach the BBC listeners. I'm sure they know this. But
just to make a point, there was international settlement controlled by the Brits
and Australians and Americans and French concession and the Chinese part. And
this was a consequence of Chinese defeat in the Opium Wars and the same treaty
that gave the UK Hong Kong for, you know, more than a century created this
Shanghai administration system. But that allowed for this kind of chaos that you
describe spies, gangsters, prostitutes, refugees, enormous wealth, right? So
there was this preponderance of chaotic humanity in Shanghai that is internally
and entirely fascinating to me. Yeah, me too. I need to get your reading list
after this. Okay, just finally, some literary gossip, if you'll permit me. In
the epilogue to the book, you describe a meeting you had with someone who sounds
a lot like Susan Sontag from your description, which occurs in Jerusalem in
2001. Did that meeting happen? Was she as angry with you as she appeared to be?
And if so, why? I was in Jerusalem in 2001. I was in Jerusalem in 2014, I
believe, and Susan Sontag was not there. I did meet her in Toronto in like, I
think, 2000 or so. And she wasn't angry with me as I perceived it, but she
wasn't, you know, exactly enthusiastic to meet me. We were introduced to each
other and she said, a little bit of a scary voice, she said, oh, I know exactly
who he is. And I froze. And I didn't know what it meant. And so then I, in that
confusion, I said, well, I know exactly who you are. And if anyone was
unmistakable, you could not confuse Susan Sontag with anyone else. And I loved
her work. I had read it. And this was even before she went to Sarajevo and, you
know, produced a play with some of the people who were friends of mine, are
friends of mine. So I dramatized it for that reason, to dramatize the sense of
guilt and disorientation by the character who, you know, vaguely resembles me.
But she did receive the Jerusalem Prize around that time. So it was plausible
that she was there. It's just that I wasn't there. Well, whether or not she was
happy to see you, we are always happy to see you. Thanks for talking to me
today. Thank you. My pleasure. My thanks to Alexander Hemon. The World and All
That It Holds is out now, published by Picador. And speaking of holding things,
let's find out what Roddy Doyle would never let go of. It's his book I'd Never
Lend. The book I'd Never Lend is Sweet Soul Music by Peter Guralnik. It's a
brilliant, vivid account of some of the major figures in soul music, names that
would be familiar to a lot of us. Otis Redding, James Brown, and then perhaps
slightly less familiar, Solomon Burke. And I bought the book in 1986 in London.
I was over there. I was a regular visitor to London, still am. And it coincided
with my writing The Commitments, which is a story about a group of kids here in
Dublin forming a soul band. And I think the energy and spirit and the
personalities that I was reading about in Peter Guralnik's book infected in a
very good way what I was writing. So the book really means a lot to me. The
particular edition I have, it's lived in a fair few bedsits, two houses. I
suspect at one stage it was maybe resting on top of a radiator. I took it down
recently and I realised if I cracked it open to read from the centre of it, it
was going to fall apart more than likely. And it's a beautiful edition. So I did
open the book very, very carefully and gingerly and photographed part of a page
from early on. It's a passage about Solomon Burke. So I'll read it now. Solomon
had no competition. There has never been a warmer, more charismatic presence on
stage. And when he stretched out his arms to the audience, when he declared at
the outset, there's a song that I sing and I believe if everybody was to sing
this song, it would save the whole world. There was scarcely anyone in that
frenzied crowd who could resist either the message or the conviction that
seemingly lay behind it. When I first met him some 15 years later, he was just
the same, only bigger. His 200 plus pounds had swelled to 300 plus pounds. His
congregation, on the other hand, had diminished from a theatre full of secular
parishioners ready to testify to a small club in New York City whose sparse
audience was made up mostly of white faces and a few curious Japanese tourists.
I selected that passage because it's a bit tragic in a way. Instead of a
description of a star on the up, it's a star on the way down. Luckily, it didn't
stay that way because Solomon Burke had a resurgence of popularity later on,
quite close to his death, actually, which is a nice way to go. But it's very
human as well. And the charisma of the man, and I've been in that audience
myself, if he says this song will change the world, you're inclined to believe
it. I think in the almost 40 years, 37 years since I read the book, my love of
soul music hasn't diminished. And four decades later, the term timeless still
bang on. And I think the book brings me back to a time when I was in my 20s, a
school teacher, setting out on what I didn't know would be a career in writing.
And it seems to me, when I think of the book, I feel as fresh as I did back
then. So it's very precious to me. There have been later editions, and there's
another edition on the way later this year. But this particular edition is, it's
almost biblical, or like a Bible to me. I'm just gonna be a witness tonight. I'm
just gonna be a say I love you. I'm gonna be a say I love you. Roddy Doyle on
the sacred text that is Sweet Soul Music by Peter Guralnick. Roddy's latest
collection of short stories, Life Without Children, is out now in paperback from
Vintage. He's also a judge on this year's BBC National Short Story Award, which
is open as I speak to any published writers among you. More details can be found

Book with me, Chris Power, on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Finally today, a fresh and
exciting novel from Hong Kong, a place of multiple languages and a contested
history, where numerous challenges face its contemporary writers. Owlish by
Dorothy Che is a rare beast in more than one sense, an experimental piece of
fiction from a city rarely celebrated as a literary hub, and one among
relatively few Hong Kong titles which has been translated into English. To
discuss it, I'm very pleased to say that Dorothy joins me from there now, along
with the translator Natasha Bruce down the line from Amsterdam. Welcome to you
both. Dorothy, Owlish takes place in a dreamlike reality where Professor Q falls
in love with a porcelain doll. It unfolds in Nevers, a city of protests. Can you
tell us a bit more about this unusual world? Indeed, Nevers is a place inspired
by Hong Kong. And for me, Hong Kong has always been an interesting place, not
just because of its unique history and political situation, but as a densely
populated city, it has a lot of hidden spaces, you know, like second floor
bookshops, rooftop farms, for example. Shopping malls went from being palaces of
commercialism into gathering places for protesters. So in my novel, Flew, a
Professor's Hidden Desire for a Music Box Ballerina, I hope to reveal the hidden
sides of a city. That reminds me of something I read in your afterwords to the
novel, where you describe Hong Kong as a city that exists at the intersection of
dreaming and being awake. Is it simply that for you, that's the most accurate
way of depicting Hong Kong as this kind of otherworldly place? I think there is
a moment during the political movement in 2019, people like to say when they
protest, we are going to dream. It's a way to hide from the escaped kind of like
censorship of the internet to talk about you're going on to a protest, you're
going on dreaming. And so I think I have a strong feeling about the city's
energy at the time, like how people were, we used to think Hong Kong is like a
very capitalist city. But in fact, during the political movement, I see the
other side of the city. And I think what I try to grasp in my novel is this
energy and subconsciousness rather than what's happening on the surface. I'd
like to turn to Natasha now. Natasha, could you tell us a bit about the
translation process and how it worked with Dorothy? I mean, you spent time in
Hong Kong. Was that very helpful when it came to translating this book? I'm sure
it was. Yeah, I would say that actually, also the translation of Owlish has been
kind of quite a unique process for me in terms of translating a book because
I've been able to collaborate with Dorothy really closely on it. And I did live
in Hong Kong for a few years before Dorothy had finished Owlish. And I was
working on some of her short stories in that period. But then actually, just as
I was leaving Hong Kong, which was 2018, so just before the 2019 protests,
Dorothy was finishing Owlish. And we had this idea that we would apply for some
residencies together in the US. And it was really interesting because Dorothy
was finishing Owlish and I guess had a bit of distance then to finish writing
the book away from Hong Kong. And I was working on the opening chapters because
we thought, OK, then we'll have them ready to show to English language
publishers. But at that point, because Owlish hadn't even yet been finished in
Chinese, then I felt that we were having this really interesting conversation
about where the book was going. And I saw some drafts that then ended up
changing quite dramatically later on in 2019, I think also once things had
changed more in Hong Kong. That's incredible. What an intimate translation
process. Dorothy, there's the magazine Fleurs des Lettres, which you helped
found. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? Sure. The magazine was
founded by a group of writers and scholars and visual artists in 2006. And at
the time, the Internet was not very popular. We really wanted to create a
platform for younger writers and also make the magazine more visually attractive
and appealing to a wider readership. We also saw the magazine as a way to
intervene in the social and cultural issues in the city. So the magazine is
still running, but under the current political situation and atmosphere in Hong
Kong, it is facing some challenges now. To return to Owlish, when I read it, I
thought of it in terms of magical realism. Do you see it that way? Or does it
connect with other literary styles in Hong Kong that we might not be so aware of
in the West? Yeah, I think many people would describe my work like surrealist or
magical realist. And I do think that there has been a tradition of maybe
modernist and even postmodernist tradition of literature in Hong Kong. I think
it even can trace back to the 1930s, when the time when Shanghai is a cultural
center and Hong Kong is very connected with Shanghai. And Hong Kong has been
like a cosmopolitan city. And it's very easy to follow the latest cultural
trends in the world. And writers are very open to world literature. For example,
people are very familiar with Cavino, Kafka, Marquez. So I just feel that there
is a tradition of avant-garde writing in Hong Kong. And there's a wealth of
writers from the region, but there aren't a huge amount of them that get
translated from Chinese into English. Are there any, Dorothy, that you'd like to
see celebrated outside of the region? Yeah, I do feel a little sad that Hong
Kong literature is not very well translated. And I think many of the writers
should be translated. For example, there is one of the most beloved writer
called Sisi from Hong Kong. And she just passed away a couple months ago. And
most of her work was not translated. And I'm very glad that Jennifer Feeley, the
translator, is going to translate one of her novels called Allergy for Breasts.
And then I also recently co-translated a poetry book by a Hong Kong poet called
Yam Gong, who used a lot of Cantonese in his work. And the book is called Moving
a Stone, which I co-translated with James Shea. So I just hope that more and
more Hong Kong writers can be celebrated outside Chinese language. Fantastic
titles to add to the book list. Natasha, do you have any recommendations? Yes, I
was actually hoping to add to that list. This is a title also translated by
Jennifer Feeley, who is having a really prolific year. But next year, a book
called Tongueless is going to come out by a Hong Kong writer called Lau Yi-Wa.
And I'm very excited because I think it's really a kind of psychological
thriller noir kind of book about two rival teachers in a Hong Kong secondary
school. And they're told that they have to switch their language of instruction
from Cantonese to Mandarin. And that's the premise. And it goes from there. And
I think, yeah, I'm looking forward to it a lot. My thanks to the novelist
Dorothy Che and translator Natasha Bruce. Owlish is out now, published by
