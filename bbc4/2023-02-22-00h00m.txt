Nurses have agreed to pause their two-day strike next week as they begin pay
talks with the government tomorrow. Thousands of members of the Royal College of
Nursing in England were due to walk out on Wednesday next week. The General
Secretary of the RCN, Pat Cullen, believes a deal is possible. I think this is a
significant step forward. Every nurse in England today can breathe a sigh of
relief and more importantly our patients can. So let's get round the table
tomorrow. I'm very confident with the move from government and certainly we will
do our very best to make sure that a fair pay deal is obtained. President Biden
says the United States and its allies won't waver in their support for Ukraine.
He said in a speech in Poland that Russia's bid for land and power would fail.
He was speaking hours after President Putin used a speech in Moscow to blame the
West for the war in Ukraine and announced that Russia was suspending its
involvement in a key nuclear arms treaty. The SMP leadership contender, Kate
Forbes, has denied her campaign has been derailed by comments on gay marriage.
Some key backers of the Finance Secretary have withdrawn their support after she
said she would have voted against equal marriage laws. Ms Forbes, a member of
the Free Church of Scotland, said people wanted politicians to give straight
answers. Shoppers at some supermarkets are being told they can buy only limited
amounts of fruit and vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce because
of shortages. ASDA is restricting customers to just three of each item and
Morrisons is to bring in similar measures tomorrow. The problem has been caused
by bad weather in the Mediterranean and low domestic production. Football.
Liverpool have been thrashed 5-2 by Real Madrid in the first leg of their
Champions League round of 16 tie. The English side had gone 2-0 up at Anfield
before the Spanish champions took control of the game. BBC News. The master of
satire, David Sederis, is back with his unique blend of wit and wisdom. I know
that people are now taking pictures of themselves at funerals because when I
looked up selfies at funerals was the third option. The humorous laughs at life
and himself. I've been studying Japanese and I'll say something to Hugh. I'll
say, oh did you know that this is how you say? And he says we're only going for
four days. A new series of Meet David Sederis starts this Thursday evening at
6.30 on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Well now I'm Radio 4 Alex Edelman's peer group
in which the American comedian takes a personal look at what life's like as a
millennial with a little help from his friends. This week Alex is looking at
materialism and what millennials value in a world with so much choice. Hi I'm
Alex Edelman, a comedian, millennial and Pisces. Only two of those things are
relevant today. This is the second series of peer group, a four part series
about Generation Y. This series is different from the first and two ways. One,
you'll be hearing a bunch of my friends throughout the episodes. And two, I've
got a bit of a bitter outlook now considering how much money I lost on Bitcoin.
This episode focuses on material things, what we need and what we value. I find
I don't need much actually, I'm very set in my ways. I'm still using old ten
pound notes. It's a fight at Tesco's every day. They're like it's not legal
tender anymore. Well it is to me dammit. I'm Alex Edelman, this is peer group.
As a generation we are pretty poor. So the irony of talking about what we would
like to own is not lost on me. It's like an armistice man talking about his
favorite watches. But when I asked all my friends what they wanted, no one said
an actual thing besides a house. Everyone said they would like a house. But come
on, what is it, 2009? Silly millennials thinking they deserve shelter and
retirement before 85. But a lot of these rosy eyed dreamers told me that in
terms of material things there's actually too much to choose from. This is my
friend Alfie. We've been promised everything and there's too much on offer. So
anything that isn't everything feels like a sacrifice. I actually love that from
Alfie. Someone told me once that there are 15,000 different kinds of hot
chocolate. That's too many. It should just be like the stir bit and the pour
bit. Has anyone been to an artisanal ice cream shop? A few yeses. What has
happened to ice cream? I went into a fancy new ice cream place in Brooklyn and I
knew something was wrong. Because I went up to the counter and I was like, do
you guys have chocolate? And they were like, kind of. I think what happened was
a few years ago they all got together and they were like, hey guys, you know ice
cream? Let's ruin it. Because I was like, what's your most popular flavor? And
they're like, it's a balsamic reduction. And I was like, do you know where I
could find ice cream? And then a child walked in and I was like, oh good, a
child won't put up with like this kind of bullshit. And he was like, do you have
olive oil? That's my favorite flavor. And I was like, it's not a flavor, it's
olive oil. You need to be bullied so badly. How unfair that bullying is going
out of style just as like this kind of ice cream is going into style. You're
gonna get the most annoying generation of children who are like, my favorite
flavor of ice cream is like blood orange and duck fat. Like that's not how it
works. So like the ice cream is seasonal. I feel the way about ice cream, the
way I feel about sex, which is like vanilla is fine and anything else scares me.
It's too much. There's too much choice. And I didn't know any of the choices
because I never heard of like one of the flavors. They're like, this is a Simon
and Garfunkel ice cream of the month. And I was like, what are you talking
about? Like what's Parsley, sage rosemary and I was like, come on. It's better
than the box or someone just like punches you in the face. At some point I got a
mint chocolate chip because I was like, that's the most normal kind of ice
cream. And the guy, as he hands me the mint chocolate chip, he goes, just so you
know, it's ethically made. And I was like, yeah, a whole bunch of children are
gonna like die in a mine getting me ice cream. What's ice cream that's not
ethically made? Like you trade for it with Libya or something? And he was like,
no, the mint in this ice cream is from a place called Oswego, New York, from a
shelter for people who have escaped domestic situations. And I was like, you put
sadness in my ice cream? Why would you put sadness in my ice cream? And by the
way, if those people are making ice cream flavors, they should not be making
mint chocolate chip. They should be making rocky road to reflect the emotional
journey that they've been on. And everyone I spoke to, by the way, there was a
massive amount of disaffectingness with what's on offer. And I think we've lost
this like functional understanding of how weird this amount of choice is. And I
wondered why this radical shift has taken place. And my friend David had a
slightly political reason for it. I think this generation feels that they have
been betrayed. They have been lied to. They have been sold varying sets of bills
of goods that haven't come true. And they feel that the system isn't working. So
they're interested in something radically different. It's seeing so many
failures of capitalism and also being willing to look at something that could be
radically different. The failures of capitalism like Crystal Pepsi or like
fidget spinners this year remind us that they're going to be more failures of
capitalism. So people don't get attached to much. Like I'm shocked to find I
miss stuff that was on the internet. I miss Myspace. I miss Tom. Tom. Remember
Tom? Sure. I have Facebook, but none of the founders were like personal friends.
And it wasn't like you met people that way. You sign up to Myspace already had
one friend. It was Tom. Not like that bastard Mark Zuckerberg. He's been
casually ghosting my friend request for nine years. Oh, Tom. There's something
very human about his photo. Remember he was just like wearing a white
undershirt. It's like they took the photo and like, Tom, do you want to put on
like a nicer shirt for this photo? He's like, it's not like anyone is going to
see it, guys. And he was like looking over his shoulder, presumably for like
Facebook and Twitter, which were like looming after him. Mark Zuckerberg also
loves a t-shirt, but there's something very sinister about it. Mark Zuckerberg
says he owns multiple versions of the same t-shirt as clothing because he
doesn't want to make silly decisions in the morning. This is a quote from Mark
Zuckerberg. I wear the same t-shirt every day because I really want to clear my
life so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except
how to best serve this community, which is great, except I don't believe that
pick out a different shirt, you weird robot. This is my friend and comedian,
Jack Knight. Why do you need to own things other than the fact that the American
dream is to own land and that it is and that it is that what do you got to do
with it? Sit there and just have it. I mean, I understand that logic and I get
that something will replace cars. But when I say I'm old fashioned, I'm like,
why does it have to be Uber? Uber is so weird. It's so weird. I don't think we
give any credit to how absolutely crazy Uber is as just like a concept. Uber is
a negotiation you make with your phone for every ride. It's just like a guy in
the field like, Hey, it's me, Uber. Here's the deal. You, stranger's car, 11
pounds. Deal. And we're like, deal. And then they came out with Uber pool. Has
everyone heard of Uber pool? Yes. If you're shaking it, here's Uber pool. It's
just like, Hey, it's me, Uber. New deal. You, stranger's car. Three of the
creepiest goddamn hill you've ever met. We're going from East London to West
London. They're going from North London to South London. Guess who's getting
dropped off first? It's not you. It's going to take 11 and a half hours. And
we're like, that's crazy. And it was like, wait, wait, seven pounds. And we're
like, seven pounds. And he's like, deal. And we're like, deal. Has anyone heard
of Uber express? Has anyone heard of it? Yes. It's not here yet. It's wonderful.
Here's what Uber expresses. They don't swing by, pick you up, bring your
destination, drop you off. Here's what happens. You walk to a location, they
swing by, they pick you up, they drop you off near your other location. Then
you, it's the bus. They invented the bus. Or it was like, Hey, me again. Uber,
here's the deal. You want to go from East London to West London? Here's what
happens. You walk to Stansted Airport. You fly to Heathrow via Johannesburg.
Someone swings by, they pick you up, they drop you in Shepherd's Bush. It takes
two and a half days. We're like, that's crazy. And it's like, wait, wait, wait,
four pounds. Four pounds. And it's like, deal. We're like, yeah, obviously it's
a deal. It's four pounds. By the way, here's what I didn't know. Remember Ashton
Kutcher? Yes, he's still alive. I didn't know that. Ashton Kutcher, still alive.
I just thought he was like fidget spinners, like a pop culture fad from the
2000s that was just gone. But like, no, still alive. And I found out about it
because I ran to a friend and I was like, what are you up to? He's like, I work
for Ashton Kutcher. And I was like, the estate? He's like, no, still alive. This
is crazy. My friend told me Ashton Kutcher is worth $281 million. And I was
like, why? And he went, he invested in Uber, which is crazy because it means for
Ashton Kutcher, dude, where's my car? Isn't just a crappy movie he was in. It's
a business plan that made him hundreds of millions of dollars. He's my friend
and journalist, Rebecca. I am worried that I'll never be able to buy a house,
but always have that kind of balancing voice of the fact that I don't need to
buy a house. Why do I need to buy a house and be fixed in one place? Because I
think when you get so used to being not permanent, yeah, then the idea of being
tied to one place petrifies me. I think, well, if you don't like your neighbors,
what if you decide you don't like the area, you can't just pack up and leave.
It's fixing you in one place. By the way, the idea that millennials can own
houses is like a bit of a joke. Now people are like millennials never going to
be able to own houses, but like it is what everyone I spoke to wants in terms of
like a possession. Everyone was like who need a house? But like if you get past
the fact that people aren't going to own a home, what is everyone's prized
possession? And Alfie had an answer that was really sweet. Things that I've
bought me as an adult that bring me joy. Yeah. One of which would be the huge
cast iron pot that I use to make shoes. I guess an adult sense of joy from that.
Yeah. A pot that makes stews. Clearly, you know, a family heirloom to be passed
down from generation to generation. You know, like I get that I have a pair of
shoes that I love and they're really basic. And here's why I love them because I
have one foot as a size 12 US and one foot that's a size 10 and a half US. And
now you're like, Oh, well, if you convert to the UK, is it make you not a
monster? No, it doesn't. And I'm always so weird about it. And I've always had
to buy the bigger shoes, right? I always buy size 12 US shoes because you can't
buy smaller shoes and pray for, you know, one foot to just like make it work.
Like, so here's what happens. I buy the larger shoes and one foot fits and the
other foot just like rattles around like a widow in a big house. I love that
some of you owed for that, by the way, like it was an actual widow instead of my
left foot. Like he's been dead for five years, stop collecting newspapers. And
so I always have to do this. And a few months ago I went into a shoe store on
Regent Street in London and I explained the situation to the shoe guy and he
said, Oh, that's fine. We'll sell you one shoe that's a size 12 American and one
shoe that's a size 10 and a half. And I almost started crying in a men's shoe
store. I was like, that's so nice of you. No one's ever done that for me. It's
so sweet. And he's like, it's not that big a deal. I was like, it is a big deal.
And so like, I'm checking out and I said to him, what are you going to do with
like the orphan shoes? And he's like, what? And I was like, the other shoes from
this, like, what are you going to do with them? And he said to me, Oh, I'm going
to hold on to them just in case someone with the exact opposite situation comes
into the store. And I was like, if that happens, you give that guy my number
because we are buying shoes together for the rest of our lives. I'm going to be
like, Tom, do you want to learn how to ice skate? Because this only works if
you're all in baby. But I don't collect shoes, obviously. So like when they're
done, they're done. They're like treasured possessions, but they're like out of
my life as soon as they're not useful anymore. One of my favorite memories from
childhood is I used to collect stuff. Here are the two things I collected. I
collected baseball cards and I collected a rabbi cards. And I know there are a
few of you who are like, rabbi cards aren't a thing to which I would say, hell
yes, rabbi cards are a thing. In Hebrew, they're sometimes called gedolim cards.
And they were like a cross between top trumps and panini stickers and extreme
Judaism. If you're having difficulty imagining rabbi cards, just like picture
the Anglican vicar trading cards you guys have and just like chew them up a bit.
I didn't want rabbi cards, by the way. It was just how childhood went because I
asked for baseball cards and I was given rabbi cards. And then I asked for
baseball cards again, and I'd get given rabbi cards. So then I asked for rabbi
cards and I got given rabbi cards. Like that reverse psychology just doesn't
work on my parents. But I did start asking for rabbi cards because I realized
that I could trade them for baseball cards. And once I did, you know, I had like
a whole bunch of new confidence. By the way, in terms of the rabbi cards, I know
what you guys are thinking. Was there Rav Shimon bar Yochai? Of course there was
Rav Shimon bar Yochai. He was a rare card. My friend Zach Rubinstein told me
that Rav Shimon had collected all the cards when they were first printed to make
himself more rare. And my father told me that it wasn't true and that Zach was
lying to me. And I was like, you never believe me. Why don't you believe me? And
he's like, because Rav Shimon bar Yochai died in the second century, which
really made me doubt the authenticity of the autographed Rav Shimon bar Yochai
card that Zach had traded me. Alex, were there statistics on the back of these
rabbi cards? You bet there were statistics on the back of these rabbi cards.
Knowledge, faith in God, influence, agility. Just kidding, not agility. Some of
the cards have little factoids about the rabbis. Rashi made wine. Hilo became a
rabbi at 15 and Rabbi Tarfon hit 73 home runs in a single major league season.
Actually, one of those might be very blondes, but I'm not sure. My parents were
right to give me rabbi cards instead of baseball cards because I've lost some
interest in baseball, but I am still very much an observant Jew. And I've seen a
whole bunch of baseball players in real life. But one time I met chief rabbi
Jonathan Sacks, AKA Rabbi Card 231, modern stages for the ages. And I got really
giggly. So I'm like that probably is the right one. I still collect books and
comedy memorabilia, but like a little less intensely because like I've always
craved security more than any actual like thing. Like too much. When I was a
kid, do you ever tell a story to a friend and you're like, this is a funny
story. And then everyone in the room, in my case, all my girlfriends friends
looked at me and halfway through my funny story, I was like, Oh, no one thinks
this is funny, but me. They think it's the saddest thing they've ever heard.
They were all talking about imaginary friends that they had as children. And I
was like, I had an imaginary friend. Well, not an imaginary friend. I had an
imaginary bodyguard and everyone was like, why? And I was like, well, it's very
small. And so like to make myself feel more safe, I had an imaginary bodyguard.
Isn't that funny? And everyone's like, no. And I called my mom and I was like,
mom, um, do you remember if I had an imaginary bodyguard? My mom just went, we
remember Keith. And I was like, what? And she went, give us an hour. They hung
up the phone. 45 minutes later, I get a text message video from my parents. And
it's a video of our TV screen from my childhood home, which they're recording.
And the video they're taking is shaking so hard because they're laughing so
much. It's a home video of me and my brother sitting at a kitchen table. And my
mom says to my brother, AJ, how was school? And he goes, it was good. And then
she goes, Alex, how was school? And I just went, hold on. And she was like, you
made us put out food for Keith. And I was like, well, lots of people make their
parents put out food for their imaginary friends. And she's like, you made us
put it outside so Keith could eat it while he was watching the perimeter. And by
the way, my girlfriend tried to save me because she was like, guys, it's just
basically an imaginary friend and ruining her attempt. I was like, uh, he wasn't
really a friend. We had a professional relationship. Material possessions, they
really don't mean much to me because it's security that's so important now. And
material possessions supposed to bring that, but they don't. Even in terms of
status symbols, like that's Instagram. And so like, I think for like all of
millennials is economic and securities, not being attached to stuff is like
actually a really healthy attitude. He's my friend and comedian, Moses form. Why
would you be working on all this stuff to accomplish what? When it's always
going to feel like this, the way that you're feeling now of like, you never have
enough. You need to keep working. You need to stay relevant. You need to achieve
the next thing. It's always going to feel exactly like it feels right now. You
might have a weird up year, but then there's a new challenge that arises where
it's like, now you got to sustain. Now you got to sustain. You got to put the
next huge thing out. Millennials are in pursuit of stuff, but it's not an actual
thing. I think it's in terms of like stuff that will make them feel safe and
happy just like everybody else. And I think for all of its manifest faults, my
cohort just realizes that stuff doesn't do that. Just look at Hollywood actor
Mark Wahlberg, star of Transformers and the Departed. Because this week Mark
Wahlberg published his routine. So I assume some of you have seen this and I'm
not going to bore you with the details. I'm going to entertain you with the
details. This does not sound like a happy person. Here's his routine. Mark wakes
up at 2.30 AM that he prays for half an hour and he better pray because from
3.40 AM to 5.15 AM Mark Wahlberg is working out. Spoiler alert. It's not his
last workout of the day that he showers. Sadly, it is his last shower of the
day. Fortunately for Mark, this shower is an hour and a half long. Then he has
his first of three snacks. This snack only takes half an hour. Only half an hour
for a snack? Why are you saying only? Here's why. Because snack number two is
from 8 to 9.30. The snack is an hour and a half. He would save a whole hour and
a half if he just ate one of the snacks in the shower. Mark Wahlberg spends two
and a half hours of his day just eating snacks. I just imagine Mark Wahlberg in
like a tiny room just staring at the wall eating a Kit Kat very slowly. What is
Mark Wahlberg eat? A good question. Sorry to read this. I start out with steel
oats, blueberries and peanut butter for breakfast. Then I have a protein shake,
three turkey burgers, five pieces of sweet potato and then it's 5.30 in the
morning. At 8 o'clock I have 10 turkey meatballs. At 10.30 AM I have a grilled
chicken salad with two hard boiled eggs, olives, avocado, cucumber, tomato and
lettuce. This gets really Donald Trump eat right here. Then at 1 o'clock I have
a gorgeous New York steak with green peppers. At 5.30, 6 o'clock I have an
absolutely beautiful piece of halibut or cotter sea bass with some vegetables,
maybe some sauteed potatoes and bok choy. Then I have a lot of aqua hydrate
during the day and then he goes, that's it. Has the phrase that's it ever been
used more inappropriately? First of all, that's crazy for your digestive system.
Crazy. Now we know why he spends an hour and a half in the shower. Here's my
favorite detail, golf. Mark Wahlberg golfs every day but it takes half an hour.
Golf starts at 7.30 AM and is over by 8 o'clock. Can you imagine Mark Wahlberg
playing a full round of golf in half an hour? Because I can. It's all I've done
this week is imagine. Just Mark Wahlberg clinging to a golf cart going 60 miles
an hour down a fairway with the most stressed out caddy of all time. Played by
Jack Whitehall for Comic Effect. Excuse me, can I play through? I'm Mark
Wahlberg. I have 1 minute and 44 seconds to play each of these 18 holes. Go, go,
go. Here's what's so interesting about this. Mark Wahlberg's schedule starts at
2.30 AM and ends at 7.30 PM. Does not include bathroom breaks. Unless he's just
leaning out the side of a golf cart with his pants around his ankles. The golf
carts go at 60 miles an hour. Whitehall's like, oh my god. In 2017, Forbes said
that Mark Wahlberg was Hollywood's most overpaid actor. In reading this, I was
like, no he's not. Because that's crazy. That's a horrible life. By the way,
this explains a lot. Reading through this entire schedule, which includes all
that stuff, you know what else there's no time for? Acting. He hasn't budgeted
any time for acting. So I assume they call him. They're like, Mark, do you want
to do Transformers? And he's like, yeah, can I do it during a snack? It's like,
we've let go of some of the meaning of this stuff because if we were actually
invested in physical things, the way that it's changed would actually be really
devastating. Remember I was talking about that ice cream shop? It means
something to me. Because when I was a kid, my grandfather died. My father took
me to this place in Austin, Massachusetts called the White Mountain Creamery.
And I remember this super clearly. And we went in, I had a banana split.
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry. The way that got intended. Hot fudge over the
top, bananas on the side. It was in one of those glass bowls, like the old
fashioned glass bowls. And I ate it with a long handled metal spoon. I remember
I had so much ice cream. The best bit of the meal was the sip of water at the
end to wash all the sugar out of your mouth. Your mouth feels so clean. I
remember that emotion. And my dad said to me, he's like, Alex, I'm sorry to tell
you this. Your grandfather died. And it was sad, but that was the right way to
tell me. Now imagine if my father took me to one of these artisanal ice cream
places for that. And I was like, can I have a banana split? They're like, we
don't have that. And I was like, well, what about chocolate, vanilla, and
strawberry? Like we don't have chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. We have
cigarettes, Himalayan sea salt, and lavender, bramble berry with real thorns in
it. I was like, can I have hot fudge? We don't have hot fudge. We just sprinkled
parsley over the top. Can I have it in a glass bowl? We don't have any glass
bowls. We just put on like a butcher's wood block. And like, you can get it
powder style if you want. You can just like snort it off the wood block while we
scream at you and play inaccessible jazz in the background. Um, could I have a
long handle metal spoon? We don't have a long handle metal spoon. We have clogs
carved by very sad people. We have sadness clogs and you eat your ice cream out
of your sadness clogs. And then maybe it would be better because my father would
be like, um, Alex, I was gonna tell you your grandfather died. I'd be like,
well, actually that's the second worst thing to happen to me today. Anyway, to
sum up, there isn't like a ton that this generation needs except houses. I don't
know how many times I can stress that we really need houses. And so like
speaking personally, there isn't anything that I really need. Although if anyone
has a mint condition, Eliezer Benhorkinus, the Damascus rocket, real nickname, I
needed to complete a set. I've been Alex Edelman. Good night. Alex Edelman's
peer group was written by Alex Edelman with additional material by Ivo Grant. My
peer group was Alfie Brown, Jack Knight, Moses Storm, Rebecca Nicholson, and
David Bursley. The producer was Sam Michelle and it was a BBC studios
production. And we'll join Alex again at the same time next week here on Radio 4
when he'll be looking at the very millennial preoccupation of social media.
Until then, you can hear many more episodes of Alex Edelman's peer group on BBC
Sounds. Exclusive performances by much loved artists. Now on Radio 4 to
Westminster where there are questions about who should be allowed a gun today in
Parliament. Good evening. This is Sean Curran at Westminster where there's a
call for a change in the gun laws after an inquest jury accused the police of a
catastrophic failure to protect the five people shot dead in Plymouth in 2021.
After Dunblane, firearms units were to be given as much training and guidance as
possible and yet Devon and Cornwall Police had no formal training for two
decades. Also tonight, a minister lets rip on sewage spillages. Current water
company performance is totally unacceptable. And former trade unionists condemn
the government's strike spill. This is a time for industrial relations
statesmanship, not political preening and posturing. On Monday, a jury at the
inquest into the deaths of five people who were shot in Plymouth said there had
been a catastrophic failure at the Firearms Licensing Unit of Devon and Cornwall
Police. Jake Davison shot his mother, a three-year-old child and three adults
before turning the gun on himself. The inquest found that the police had failed
to protect the victims and the public by allowing the killer to legally own a
shotgun. A Home Office minister, Chris Filp told the Commons it was a truly
horrific incident. On 12 August 2021, in Keum, Plymouth, Jake Davison shot and
killed five people, wounded two others and then took his own life. The deceased
victims were Maxine Davidson, 51, the perpetrator's mother, three-year-old
Sophie Martin and her father Lee Martin, 43, Steven Washington aged 59 and Kate
Shepherd aged 66. He said the government kept firearms licensing under review
and he told MPs changes had been made. There were strengthened controls issued
through statutory guidance in October 2021, a few months after this awful
incident, to make sure the police must ensure people are medically fit to
receive a licence and that full medical checks have been undertaken, something
which did not happen of course in this case. A new digital marker system to flag
firearms owners to GPs is also currently being introduced. The minister said
Devon and Cornwall Police had assured the Independent Office for Police Conduct
that it had made changes following a report from the watchdog. But depending on
what the coroner might recommend shortly, I am currently minded to ask the
inspectorate to go and look specifically at the arrangements that Devon and
Cornwall have in place of firearms licensing to confirm their suitability. And
he said the government would make further changes to the gun laws if they were
needed to protect the public. Labour's Shadow Home Office Minister Sarah Jones
echoed the inquest jury's criticism of the police. Under Dunblane, firearms
units were to be given as much training and guidance as possible and yet Devon
and Cornwall Police had no formal training for two decades. The firearms
licensing supervisor told the court he'd done a two-day training course in 1998
but nothing else until 2020. How could it possibly be that the person in charge
of deciding whether someone was safe with a gun hasn't even been trained on how
to use the risk manual? His casual approach to risk was dangerous and proved to
be fatally flawed. The Labour MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, Luke
Pollard, said his community was angry and he called for comprehensive changes to
the gun laws. We've been failed locally by our police but nationally we're also
being failed by gun laws that need to be brought up to date. The families of the
victims and those who survived want to see changes. A review of gun laws to
bring them up to date to make them 21st century. An urgent review of gun
licensing which has failed us so badly, not just in Devon and Cornwall but for
every other gun licensing authority everywhere else in the country. The
Conservative MP for South West Devon, Sir Gary Streeter, welcomed the review the
minister had talked about. Can I ask him not to close his mind to a thorough
review of the law in relation to firearms because I think I take the point that
it's quite ancient some of it and it needs to be brought together and looked at
in the light of internet influences as well as medical conditions. Another
Conservative, Celaine Saxby, asked about the review of the licensing
arrangements for Devon and Cornwall Police. We've already heard that it does
have a high level of gun ownership linked to those remote farms that do require
them for work but there is a concern that actually there's already a backlog in
the renewal system and that the morality is not adequately reflected in the
resources that the force receives. A Labour MP Rachel Maskell said she wasn't
reassured by the government's response. Particularly around mental health but
also for victims of domestic violence and their former partners. I've got a
constituent right now who is in hiding because her former partner has had his
firearms returned to him. So what reassurance can he give to ensure that this
incident will be the last and that my constituent will also be safe. Chris Philp
said firearms licenses weren't a right. A Conservative, Sir Julian Lewis, had
another concern. Is it correct as I think has been reported that in this tragic
case the murderer's mother appealed to the police to have the returned firearm
removed from him and was ignored? If that is true, isn't it also the case that
no change in any licensing system will be able to compensate for that level of
bungling incompetence? The minister said very bad decisions had been taken in
this case. Now the government has faced calls from its own MPs to up its game
and force water companies to invest in infrastructure. The demand came as a
minister was again urged to do more to stop raw sewage spills. Alicia McCarthy
reports. Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary Jim McMahon reckoned people were
sick and tired of sewage in streams, rivers and seas. The water companies know
they can laugh all the way to the bank because the government won't take action.
The regulators know the government won't take action because they are taking
away the capacity to take action from the regulators and all the while it's
local people who are suffering. The Environment Minister Rebecca Powell told him
she'd been clear that current water company performance was totally unacceptable
and both the British people and the government expected better. She said the
firms must act urgently to improve but added that since privatisation they had
spent billions on infrastructure. And because of our new storm overflow
reduction plan they are now committed to £56 billion of investment up until 2050
and £7.1 billion of that is already underway and that includes the Thames
Tideway Super Sewer. The conservative MP Caroline Noakes explained that some of
her constituents had suffered disruption to their supplies three times in just
five months, including in the run up to Christmas. Constituents of mine have
gone without water to wash with, to drink, to cook with, to flush the loo with
for days on end. Caroline Noakes said customers needed better ways to hold water
companies to account and rather than find she wanted a levy forcing them to
invest in the network. Rebecca Powell agreed the failure was unacceptable and
was asking for another urgent meeting with the water company involved. But a
neighbouring MP and fellow conservative Paul Holmes said 20,000 of his
constituents had been without water before Christmas and thousands just last
week, something that he said stemmed from a chronic lack of investment. Will the
government up its game now in not asking water companies to invest in
infrastructure but enforce them to do so going forward? The minister insisted
the government was taking steps, water companies now had to have action plans
and her department was consulting on raising the cap on fines for environmental
pollution to £250 million, something Labour's Geraint Davis thought couldn't
come soon enough. Water bosses are actively allowing more pollution because they
know it's cheaper to pay the fines than do the investment to mend the leaks and
to stop the sewage. The Lib Dem former leader Tim Farron represents part of the
Lake District and reeled off a list of rivers that had suffered sewage outflows.
And on Windermere Lake at the heart of the English Lake District, 71 days of
sewage flows. All of this, outrageously, is legal. So when is the government
going to force the water companies not just to clean up their act but to clean
up our lakes and our rivers too? Rebecca Powell wasn't having that. If I might
say he's a fine one to talk because I believe the Liberal Democrats had the
water minister under the coalition and what exactly did he do? The Green Party
MP Caroline Lucas said during 2020 and 2021, raw sewage was dumped in Britain's
rivers and seas more than 770,000 times. But the pay of water company executives
increased, on average, by a fifth. She too wanted firms to be forced to invest
profits in improving infrastructure and... Will she look again at bringing
companies into public ownership so money is properly reinvested not siphoned off
to shareholders? She doesn't seem to understand why people are so angry when
those water companies are swimming in cash and the rest of us are swimming in
sewage. The minister insisted there was now more monitoring of water companies'
performance and there would be more investment in infrastructure. Alicia
McCarthy. The Royal College of Nursing has called off next week's 48-hour strike
in England to restart pay talks with the government but with walkouts by
teachers and rail workers still on the cards, ministers are pressing ahead with
a bill to reduce the impact of stoppages on some key services. When members of
the Lords debated the proposals for the first time, a government minister, Lord
Callahan, told them the number of days lost during the second half of last year
was the highest since 1989. This bill aims to maintain a reasonable balance
between the ability of workers to strike with the rights and freedoms of the
public to access those essential services during those strikes. Under the plans,
some employees, for instance in the rail industry and emergency services, would
be required to work during industrial action and they could be sacked if they
refused. But Lord Callahan was insistent. This legislation is not about sacking
workers, it is about protecting people's lives and livelihoods by enabling
minimum service levels to be applied during strikes. But speaking for Labour,
the former TUC General Secretary, Frances, now Lady O'Grady, wondered if the
minister had considered what she called the real world consequences of the bill.
It would poison relations between employers and unions by rigging the balance of
power still further against working people and by seeking to frustrate the
effective expression of legitimate grievances. A Conservative former Minister,
Lady Browning, highlighted the impact of strikes in emergency services. When I
leave home and come here during the week, I leave behind carers in charge of
somebody I love very much. And the last time there was an ambulance strike, I
basically said as I went through the door, don't take him out for a walk today.
Now that was because I didn't want to put that additional risk into his life. A
crossbench or independent peer, Lord Judge, who used to be the Lord Chief
Justice of England and Wales, was worried that the powers in the bill to set
minimum service levels didn't require parliamentary scrutiny. A unilateral
change in the contracts of employment of hundreds, thousands and thousands of
people can be changed by a piece of secondary legislation. And that's all this
bill is. Labour has pledged to repeal the law if it gets into government, but a
Conservative Lord Dobbs thought it would survive. No future government is going
to lay itself open to the accusation that they are anti-patient, anti-commuter,
anti-student and anti-ordinary worker. No Labour government will risk the
accusation they sold the public interest out to any paymaster. The bill cleared
its first hurdle in the Lords and it now goes for more detailed scrutiny when
peers will have the chance to make changes. You're listening to Today in
Parliament with me, Sean Curran, still to come, the astounding effect of kicking
the habit. If smoking disappeared, the great majority of this, the worst of our
cancers, would just disappear. But first, MPs say voters in England could be
turned away from polling stations this May because of new rules requiring photo
ID. But a minister rejected claims that the change was designed to benefit the
Conservatives. David Cornock explains. Voters going to the polls at council
elections in England this May will be required to show a form of photo ID such
as a passport or driving licence. People without an approved document can apply
online for a free voter authority certificate. But official figures suggest
take-up so far has been slow. A Liberal Democrat, Helen Morgan, said requiring
photo ID was a thinly veiled attempt by ministers to make it more difficult to
vote. They'll be aware that the Electoral Commission's analysis that this rushed
rollout means that the May elections can't be run, in their words, in a fully
secure, accessible and workable manner. And she said of two million people who
would now need a new form of ID, only one percent had applied. Does the
government have any handle on the level of awareness amongst the general public
regarding the need to bring ID with you to vote this May? I would say that the
government is sleepwalking into a disaster, but I'm afraid to me this looks a
little bit more cynical. The local government minister, Lee Rowley, said many of
those two million potential voters wouldn't have local elections this year. Of
that group, a number will choose not to vote, much as we would like them to do
so. We would have chosen never to have voted and we would encourage them to do
so, but ultimately that is what the purpose of a democracy is. People have a
right both to vote and not to vote and we are seeking to encourage them to do
so. We're seeking to guarantee that integrity. He said it was estimated that
around 98 percent of the electorate did have a valid form of photo ID. Alex
Norris for Labour said the scheme was a solution in search of a problem. You are
more likely to be struck by lightning 54 times than you are to be queuing behind
a person committing voter fraud at their polling station. He said there were
only 72 days until the local elections. We are risking widespread
disenfranchisement. When is the minister going to wake up and act to prevent
these voter ID requirements from locking huge numbers of people out of their
democracy at the next election? Lee Rowley dismissed his argument. The normal
gentleman continues to perpetuate the myth that this is some form of
suppression. It's absolutely incorrect and we have a responsibility in this
place. Putting aside party political views, we have a responsibility in this
place to make sure we are temperate with our language, particularly when it
relates to something as important as a ballot box. Chris Stevens for the SNP
questioned why older people could use their travel passes as a means of ID, but
younger people couldn't. It would seem that there is some gerrymandering going
on, Madame Deputy Speaker. The fact that types of ID for student and under 30
Oyster cards will not be accepted, but Oyster cards for over 60s will be
accepted. The terrorism minister explained that. Lee Rowley said older people
had to show their passport or driving licence to get their travel card, whereas
the rules for other passes were less strict. A Conservative Paul Bristow
wondered what all the fuss was about. Picking up a parcel, borrowing a library
book, voting in internal Labour party elections, these are all activities for
which you require photo ID. The minister agreed with me that this battle, this
argument has already been won. The minister agreed, but Labour's Clive Ethel
wasn't persuaded. All the independent research indicates that this will
disadvantage people who are least likely to vote Tory. So can the minister tell
us, what is it that attracted him to this piece of legislation? Absolutely,
safeguarding the integrity of the ballot box for the long term. The new rules
will apply in England at council elections and across the UK at Westminster
elections. The SNP's Alison Thewlis was worried about possible confusion. Can he
explain to me how it will be that people will understand the requirement for
voter ID in Westminster elections when there are different franchises, there are
different elections and the challenge for many of us trying to campaign in
elections is getting people registered at all. Surely it's going to be the case
that people are going to turn up expecting to vote and not being able to. You're
here. Lee Rowley acknowledged that elections were run differently in different
nations, but he said that was nothing new. David Cornock reporting. Now this
April will be the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. Labour's Shadow
Justice Secretary Steve Reid has questioned how the government can achieve its
plans to rewrite the UK's human rights law and introduce a Bill of Rights
without breaching the agreement. His proposed Bill of Rights will mandate
British courts to override the European Convention on Human Rights in certain
circumstances and restrict access to Convention rights through British courts,
but the Good Friday Agreement guarantees direct access to the courts for any
breaches of the Convention. The Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs that
under his plans the UK would remain a state party to the European Convention on
Human Rights. We can remain absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement
with the Bill of Rights, not least because if he bothered to read it, the ECHI
has retained within a schedule to the Bill of Rights. Steve Reid pursued his
point. The truth is he has no answer to that question and his plans to rip up
the Human Rights Act would create fresh divisions in Northern Ireland where
there's still no agreement over the protocol. So what discussions has he had
about these reckless plans with the Government of the Republic of Ireland or
with the US Government who have made clear that any unilateral attempt to weaken
Convention rights in Northern Ireland would threaten a future US-UK trade deal?
Can I think of it? He needs to read the Bill of Rights. It envisages a state
party. It retains in a schedule the ECHI, which is why all of the other concerns
that he has melt away. The SNP's Stuart MacDonald wanted Dominic Raab, who's
also the Deputy Prime Minister, to offer what he called a full-throated defence
of the European Convention on Human Rights. Both the Prime Minister and Deputy
Prime Minister have repeatedly failed to rule out withdrawal from the Convention
in the longer term and the impact of that would be international humiliation for
this country and a severe blow to international human rights. It's actually
shocking that these questions even have to be asked of any government. During
the exchanges, the Justice Secretary said the Government had made it clear that
it wouldn't rule out ever withdrawing from the ECHI in the future. He said the
UK needed a legal regime that could tackle illegal immigration. At the moment,
probably the single biggest UK concern around human rights is the trade and
misery that we see with small boats and illegal immigration across the country.
So if he's committed to human rights, he should back us in taking every measure
that we conceivably can to deal with that problem. Dominic Raab. Now, the
Government's Chief Medical Advisor, Sir Chris Whitty, has criticised tobacco
companies for marketing cigarettes at what he called the most vulnerable
teenagers. He also told MPs on the Health Committee that it was completely
unacceptable for vape manufacturers to try to attract children to their
products. Christina Cooper reports. During the pandemic, Sir Chris Whitty became
a household name, answering questions alongside ministers at televised Covid
briefings. His profile is lower nowadays, but he's still the most senior health
official in the UK. And so the Health Committee asked him to be the first
witness at a major new inquiry into preventing illness. The committee chair, the
Conservative Steve Brine, set out the scope of the investigation. In your view,
as our Chief Medical Officer, is the NHS sustainable in the future without a
complete step change in how we prevent ill health? Professor Whitty replied that
disease prevention was one major way to make the health service more efficient.
He said a large number of the most severe diseases were preventable or could be
diagnosed early, when they were easier and cheaper to treat. For example, he
said cervical cancer was very preventable thanks to vaccines or screening, and
lung cancer was highly preventable. Lung cancer is our number one killer of a
cancer. It's a horrible way to die. Most people who are diagnosed die within a
year, very unpleasantly. 79% of all lung cancers are preventable. The great
majority of that is caused by smoking. Cigarette packets in the UK are required
to carry a warning that smoking kills. However, the latest figures from the
Office for National Statistics reveal that nearly seven million people in the UK
smoke. Professor Whitty explained what would happen if they all gave up. If
smoking disappeared, the great majority of this, the worst of our cancers, were
just disappeared. Professor Whitty condemned tobacco companies for targeting the
most vulnerable in society. The cigarette industry goes to the most vulnerable
teenagers, and it aims to addict them at that stage of their lives, and then
when they find they can't come off, they're hooked. Most people who smoke don't
want to smoke. This is framed by the cigarette industry as an issue of choice.
Actually, they have deliberately taken the most vulnerable children and people
in society and taken their choice away from them by addicting them at an early
stage of their life. The conservative Caroline Johnson, who's also a GP, was
concerned that vaping, a safer alternative to cigarettes, had become a fad.
Heavily marketed at children, which is developing a whole generation of
teenagers completely addicted to sucking little nicotine sort of coloured pop
things. Sir Chris Whitty said vaping rates among children had doubled over the
last few years, and marketing it to them was utterly unacceptable. As well as
smoking, he identified air pollution, outdoor and indoor, and obesity as other
major problems. But he told Steve Bryan they could be fixed if there was a will
to do so. If Parliament chooses to enact some of the things it could do, we
could improve things like air pollution, reduce things like smoking, and reduce
the risks of obesity and the most vulnerable. So those are political choices.
But it's self-evident that those choices are not being made to the extent that
you would like. Correct. Professor Whitty said deprivation was very clearly
linked to worse health. He complained that people living with obesity were
unhelpfully framed as making individual choices. But in areas with higher
obesity levels, the food and exercise choices were heavily constrained. You
might, for example, go up at High Street, one chicken shop after another. No,
that's not a single app, chicken shops particularly. But just to make the point
that the range of choices that are available in much more affluent areas are
simply not there and the facilities are simply not there. And depressingly, he
said, health deprivation was deeply entrenched, with the areas most affected by
Covid and obesity often the same places that had the highest child mortality
rates in the 1860s. The SNP's Martin Day was flabbergasted to hear that some
areas had problems dating back to the 19th century. It seems to me dealing only
with the consequences of poor diet and higher weight isn't enough. We need to
tackle poverty. Poverty is such an underlying factor. But as you've quite
rightly said, that requires often a political decision. Sir Chris Whitty agreed
it was for political leaders to take decisions. But he pointed out that the soft
drinks levy was an extraordinarily successful policy, leading to a reduction in
sugar content and slightly higher sales. I've been quite struck by how many of
the political leaders are expecting industry to say please give us no more
regulations, no regulations. And quite the reverse. What industry says is we
quite like to do this, but if you don't put a regulation in place our
competitors will try and undercut us. His take home message was that more health
spending should be directed towards preventing illness. A conservative MP, Paul
Bristow agreed. But... It's a very difficult thing to achieve, I think. What we
need to achieve is change our mind. That is why we are so fortunate to have bold
political leaders who can take these long-term decisions. A remark which amused
the committee chair, Steve Brine, who joked that he could see why Professor
Whitty had lasted so long as chief medical officer for England. Christina
Cooper. MPs have condemned the Indian government after the country's tax
authorities raided the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai, weeks after the
broadcaster aired a documentary in the UK critical of the Prime Minister
Narendra Modi. The DUP's Jim Shannon said the justification of financial
irregularities had been used before to shut down freedom of speech. Let's be
very clear. This was a deliberate act of intimidation following the release of
an unflattering documentary about the country's leader. Since its release there
has been a concerted effort to prevent the documentary's screening in India. He
seemed surprised that the British government hadn't made any comment about the
raids. A Foreign Office Minister David Rutley said he was following the matter
closely. Respect for the rule of law is an essential element of an effective
democracy. So too is an independent media and freedom of speech. They make
countries stronger and more resilient. That's why we regularly engage with
different parts of India's media and support it. The minister said he couldn't
comment on the specifics of the matter but several MPs, including Labour's
Hilary Benn, wanted to hear a more forceful response. He said India's ruling
party had... Actually describe the BBC as the most corrupt organisation in the
world. Is it not incumbent upon the government to stand up for the BBC and its
integrity? David Rutley insisted the government did stand up for the BBC and it
considered the world service to be vitally important. And that brings us to the
closing headline from Westminster. There's been a call for the gun laws to be
changed following the verdicts of unlawful killing in the inquest into the
Plymouth shootings in 2021. We are making changes to the way BBC live streams
