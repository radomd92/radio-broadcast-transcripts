 FEM 198 longwave, digital radio and on BBC Sounds. Hello, good evening. It's 10
o'clock. Welcome to The World Tonight. I'm Raziya Iqbal. The US says it's
extremely concerned by rising levels of violence between the state of Israel and
the Palestinians. There is a local organisation of young people who cannot take
it anymore, who have very little to lose and above all who are ready to die. And
those are obviously the most devoted people and also the most dangerous people.
We'll be live in Jerusalem. The UN General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly for
Russia to withdraw immediately from Ukraine. But not every nation is joining
what appears to be a united front. The war in Ukraine is a very tragic event,
but it's certainly not the only war in the world. And what countries in the
global south reject is the effort to make this into a global war and make them
pay something that Europeans should take care of. Also in the programme. Turnip,
coconut and pistachio puree. Grated turnip with turnip leaves. Confeed and
pickled baby turnip. The Environment Secretary says people could be eating
homegrown turnips instead of Spanish salad. But the biggest turnip farmer in the
UK tells us why he stopped growing them. That's all after the BBC News read
tonight by Tina Ritchie. The United Nations General Assembly has voted
overwhelmingly to demand that Russia immediately and unconditionally withdraw
its troops from Ukraine, a day before the first anniversary of Moscow's
invasion. 141 countries backed the motion which has no legal weight, while seven
opposed it and 32 abstained, including one of Russia's staunchest allies, China,
our correspondent, Nedha Talfik reports from New York. Nearly one year on
positions on the war remain largely unchanged. This outcome is in line with the
voting records of past General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine. Nearly three
quarters of the world body has demanded Russia withdraw its troops immediately
and has called for a comprehensive just and lasting peace. With no end in sight
to the war, Ukraine and its supporters urged nations to stand up for the
principles enshrined in the UN Charter. Only a handful of Russia's staunchest
allies voted against it, including Belarus, North Korea and Syria. Those who
chose to abstain including China, India and South Africa, all expressed their
view that the resolution would not help bring the parties closer to peace. They
said only dialogue and diplomacy would lead to a sustainable resolution of the
conflict. BBC News understands that an off duty police officer seriously injured
in County Terone got up during the attack and warned children to run away.
Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell had been coaching a football practice
session shortly before he was targeted at a sports centre in Omer last night. He
remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Assistant Chief
Constable Mark McEwen described what happened to his colleague. John was
finishing up. He was accompanied by his young son, putting footballs into the
boot of his car. When two young men appeared, fired multiple shots, John ran a
short distance and as he fell to the ground, the gone men continued to fire
shots at him. At this time, there were many other young people, children,
awaiting pickup by their parents. New children ran for cover in sheer terror.
The attack is being treated as attempted murder. Three men remain in custody.
Investigators are keeping an open mind about the motive but say the distant
Republican group, the new IRA, is the primary focus of the inquiry. The UN's
Middle East envoy has held meetings in Gaza as part of efforts to calm
escalating tensions between the Palestinians and the Israelis. A general strike
was held today by Palestinians after yesterday's Israeli raid in the occupied
West Bank left 11 people dead and more than 80 injured. From Jerusalem, here's
our Middle East correspondent, Tom Bateman. The raid in Nablus was the deadliest
by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank for nearly two decades. Palestinian
leaders have demanded international protection given the number of civilians
among the dead and wounded. But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
today praised Israeli forces and vowed, in his words, to hit terrorism hard. It
has raised further fears of spiraling violence, especially with the return of
Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip during last
night. The United Nations envoy to the region, Tor Wennesland, travelled to Gaza
and met leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, while the UN's
Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, said preventing further escalation must be
an immediate priority. Sukiya Stama has promised to shake up the way the
government works to boost economic growth. In a speech in Manchester, he set out
five missions Labour would prioritise were it to win power at the next general
election, including a pledge to make the UK the fastest growing economy among
the G7. What we need has become crystal clear growth. Economic growth is the
oxygen for our ambitions. So let me announce the economic mission of the next
Labour government. By the end of Labour's first term, we will deliver the
highest sustained growth in the G7. The disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey
Weinstein has been sentenced to another 16 years in prison for raping and
sexually assaulting a woman in 2013. He'd already been serving 23 years after
being found guilty of rape almost three years ago. Our correspondent Sophie Long
reports from outside the court in Los Angeles. Harvey Weinstein's victim
tearfully told the court how she'd carried the trauma of what he did to her for
years, that she'd been a happy, confident woman who valued herself before he
brutally assaulted her in 2013. She said no prison sentence could erase the
damage, but the maximum term would restore faith in the justice system among
victims. Harvey Weinstein responded and said, I maintain my innocence. I do not
know her. She does not know me. Judge Lisa Lynch handed down a 16 year prison
sentence to be served consecutively with the 23 year term he received for his
convictions in New York. At 70 and in ill health, the man who lived life in the
luxury Beverly Hills hotels where he committed some of his crimes will likely
die in prison. The Football Association has led tributes to John Watson, one of
the sport's most recognisable commentators following his death at the age of 77.
In a 50 year career with the BBC, he covered 10 World Cups and nearly two and a
half thousand matches, many of them on match of the day. The FA said his iconic
voice would always be synonymous with the game. Barry Davis was the
corporation's other main voice of football in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. We agree
many times that our longevity on the programme of match of the day was helped by
the fact that we had two very different styles. And I think you'd agree if you
were a regular watcher that that was the case and it worked well for the
programme and it worked well for the two of us too. Barry Davis, reflecting on
John Watson, who's died. Tina, thank you. You're listening to The World Tonight
with Razia Iqbal. There appears to be both a grim outlook and dangerous
developments between Israelis and Palestinians. Just yesterday, there was a
fierce battle following a raid in the West Bank city of Nablus, the Palestinian
commercial centre by the Israeli army in which 11 Palestinians were killed and
dozens more wounded. Today, there have been efforts to calm the situation. The
UN's Middle East envoy has been meeting Hamas leaders in Gaza, where Israel
carried out airstrikes after Palestinian militants fired rockets at southern
Israel. All of this is happening in a particular context. The most right wing
nationalist ultra religious government in Israel and a generation of young
Palestinians who continue to struggle living under both Israeli occupation and a
Palestinian leadership that many feel don't represent them. Some of them are
turning increasingly to violence. Let's begin with our Middle East
correspondent, Tom Bateman, who joins us from Jerusalem. Tom, paint the picture
for us given what happened in Nablus yesterday and also those rockets that were
fired into southern Israel and the Israeli response. Well, I headed up to Nablus
in the hours after the raid in the hours after the Israeli troops had withdrawn.
The first place we went was one of the hospitals. Now, the most striking thing
about this in terms of what we witnessed on the wards was simply the number of
people wounded with injuries from live ammunition from bullets. And that was, I
think, a result of the fact that this took place in the middle of the morning.
Now, often the Israelis will carry out these raids before dawn or at least very
early in the morning because, you know, it makes operationally for them, it's
far more straightforward because more people are asleep and there are fewer
people to come out, basically, you know, throw stones and rocks and other things
that the Israeli jeeps, which is, you know, a frequent event that the
Palestinians is trying to resist these raids. And to Israelis, they see this
effect as a form of terrorism and they can and do actually shoot at the stone
throw. So, but in this case, they went in when the place was extremely busy in
the middle of the morning in the centre of the old city there. And I think
that's why we saw so many people wounded. I mean, it's several of the dead are
civilians and many of those wounded are as well. And I spoke today to a
paramedic, Elias Ashkar, whose father, 61 year old man, was among the dead. Now
he was shot out. He'd been leaving a mosque. He was on his way to work as a
driving instructor. And there is footage filmed from across the road that shows
him simply among a group of people. Now, if he's the Israelis were potentially
trying to shoot at stone throwers, that's according to one eyewitness, the 61
year old man was among those killed. His son is a paramedic in one of the major
hospitals there that had been doing resuscitation on two people who they
couldn't save who died. And when he pulled back the curtain to see who the
second person was, he saw it was his own father. So he discovered that his own
father, you know, was among the dead that he was potentially about to try to
save with resuscitation. So the mood among people in Nablus is extremely, you
know, depressed and concerned and worried about what this all means. And in the
meantime, further fears of a violent escalation. Tom, you've covered spikes and
escalations of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians for some time now.
Where would you place what's happened most recently in that? Well, if you look
at the, you know, purely in terms of numbers, we're at a situation, and this was
already the case towards the end of last year, where these Israeli raids, which
the Israelis say are to stem a rising tide of Palestinian armed attacks against
Israelis, but have taken many, many Palestinian lives, gunmen and civilians. If
you look at the sheer numbers, I mean, there hasn't been this kind of death toll
among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the days of the second
intifada or second Palestinian uprising from 2000 to 2005. The Israeli death
toll from Palestinian armed attacks hasn't been this bad in nearly a decade. So
things are in an extremely bad place. Now, what had happened earlier this week
is that the Americans, there seem to be some signs that after one of the worst
attacks on Israelis earlier this last month, that the Americans, the United
Nations were trying to get some kind of understanding between the Palestinian
leadership, the official Palestinian leadership, and the Israelis, which would
effectively see the Palestinians sort of pull back at trying to get United
Nations Security Council vote to censure the Israelis and the Israelis would
sort of step back or scale back some of these raids in the West Bank. But also
their precondition for that was that the Palestinian Authority regains control
in some of these key cities like Janine and Nabas that look like it might hold,
but it simply now appears to be failing. Tom Bateman, Hamidliz correspondent
joining us live from Jerusalem. Let's turn to Gaza, which is run, of course, by
the militant group Hamas and here from the Palestinian journalist, Isam Adwan,
who spoke to the World Service Programme News Hour from Gaza, where he expects
the violence to continue. I think it's creating an endless cycle of violence in
which the Palestinians are the ones who are dying the most, the Palestinians,
the ones who are suffering the most, with the mention that those those also with
whatever responses the Palestinians are having, they're always a blame on the
Palestinian side more than ever, I would say to the Israeli government. Today,
the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue to act against
perceived security threats to Israel. Israelis have mourned amid the deadliest
space of Palestinian attacks in years. We always say that we will settle
accounts with those who attack Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers, and we have
done so again. We will continue to take strong actions on all fronts near and
far in order to thwart our enemies efforts to attack us. Whoever tries to harm
us will pay the price. A short time ago, I spoke to the Israeli journalist
Gideon Levy, who has reported for Haaretz, the liberal Israeli newspaper, since
1982. I asked him what's behind the latest violence. This is part of Israel's
arrogance in the last months. It started in Jenin, by the way, where they did a
very similar raid at seven o'clock in the morning. And two, three weeks later,
they go even farther. And they are penetrating a city like Nablus, a very vivid
city at 10 o'clock in the morning when everyone is outside. And then they do
this operation, they do it because they feel that they can do it. And their
targets are particular groups of Palestinian men, gangs in particular, is that
right? Yes, it's this organization in Nablus, which is a very local
organization, is not affiliated neither to the to the PA nor to the Hamas. But
what is the target? I mean, by the end of the day, one should ask what did they
achieve? Okay, they killed two wanted people, and they created another 200
wanted people in the future. Everyone who was witnessing this this attack. I
mean, this is really a vicious circle, which never will get to its end if Israel
will continue to attack and attack. And the group that you're speaking of,
they're called the Lions Den. And these are people whom the Palestinian
Authority do not have any control over at all. Is that correct? It's totally
correct. But the Palestinian Authority has very little control everywhere today.
It is really a dead working man, I would say the Palestinian Authority. It's not
being taken seriously in any place in Nablus in the West Bank, together with
Janine. There is a local organization of young people who cannot take it
anymore, who have very little to lose, and above all, who are ready to die. And
those are obviously the most devoted people and also the most dangerous people.
In the context that you paint where the Palestinian Authority has no control
over these groups and the Israelis regard these young men as a potential
security threat to the state of Israel, that there is common ground between
those two, the PA and the Israeli state. With the Hamas and with other
opposition organizations, we had evidences in the past that PA and the Israeli
forces did collaborate. Yes, there is a common ground, but on the other hand,
you're dealing with two unequal forces while the PA is totally neutralized and
is becoming more and more irrelevant. Israeli still, they're only power around
and fighting against those groups. By the way, in Nablus, it's groups in other
places. It's just individuals who take the destiny in their hands. We had in the
last weeks attacks by teenagers, by certain year old children, because they feel
they have to do something. And these are groups that are hugely disaffected with
the Palestinian Authority as much as they are with the Israeli occupation.
Right. But the main object is obviously the Israeli occupation. I mean, they
dislike the Palestinian Authority, but they don't fight the Palestinian
Authority. They are fighting the occupation. This recent spate of violence, do
you see it as the beginning of the possibility of a third intifada? Are there
comparisons to be made with the 1990s and the early 2000s? Not at all. And yes,
there is a sense of uprising, but there is not the infrastructure which was in
the 90s and in the beginning of the 2000s. There is no leadership this time. The
Palestinians are much more divided. I mean, you can call it an intifada, but it
will not go to the well-established intifada. It will be mainly a resistance
made by individuals. And this is very hard to fight. Israeli journalist Gideon
Levy. Now, if you want to longer listen on this, our colleagues on the World
Service produced the Real Story podcast. Their latest episode is Why Is Violence
Escalating Between Israelis and Palestinians? It's available now on BBC Sounds.
The panel of experts delve into the history of the conflict and what possible
solutions there may be. To Northern Ireland now, where Detective Chief Inspector
John Caldwell is in a critical condition tonight after being shot multiple times
outside a sports complex. He was off duty and shot in front of his son and other
young people after a football coaching session in Oma County, Tyrone. Tonight,
the US State Department has strongly condemned the shooting. Three men have been
arrested and the focus of the police is a group called the New IRA. I've been
speaking to our Ireland correspondent Emma Vardy. She told me what we know about
the New IRA. Well, there's still several dissident Republican armed gangs who
operate in Northern Ireland, but the New IRA is known to be the largest and most
active of them, although they've been in the back foot over the last few years.
They were infiltrated by MI5. A number of their key leadership members were
arrested in a standing trial now, although that takes a long time to go through
the courts. But nevertheless, police will always tell you they remain an active
group and you know, part of their core beliefs is that police officers or UK
officials are legitimate targets for violence. Now, of course, that's a real
throwback to the days of old in Northern Ireland back to the days of the
conflict known as the troubles and the fringe very small groups of violent
dissident Republicans that still operate today still believe in using a campaign
of violence to bring about a united island by force effectively get rid of any
British or UK governance of Northern Ireland. So those are their core aims. But
in reality, police often just describe them today as as criminal gangs who are
involved in organized crime. Now, there are attempted attacks that can be
thwarted by police. We hear about those from time to time. It is much more rare
these days for any of their attacks to actually be carried out. Many of them
actually fail whether that's under car devices or improvised explosive devices
and things like that. So that's partly why today's attack is going to be a great
shock to the police service, a great shock to many people in Northern Ireland of
course, because to a generation of people who do remember the days of conflict,
the troubles, this evokes very dark memories. Three men have been arrested for
attempted murder. You mentioned that in some cases the police argue that these
are criminal gangs. The motive of whether it was sectarian or just criminal has
not been established yet. Well those lines can often be quite blurred when it
comes to the activity of violent dissident groups in Northern Ireland. John
Caldwell had a long career investigating many different murders. Many of those
linked to dissident activity and activity involving organized crime and he had,
we understand the number of threats made to him in the past but he wouldn't be
alone in that. So would other sort of senior officers involved in this kind of
thing and it's not yet clear if any of that is actually relevant in the events
that led up to this attack but police are making it very clear that the
suspicion is very much falling on dissident Republicans and particularly the new
IRA. Our Ireland correspondent Emma Fadi. Let's turn now to common or garden
produce because the sales of some fruit and veg have been limited by most of the
country's largest supermarkets. The shortage is being attributed to bad weather
in Europe and Africa according to the government and there is the issue of high
electricity prices on produce grown in greenhouses here and in the Netherlands.
Asked about the shortage in parliament the Environment Secretary Therese Coffey
said it could continue for another two to four weeks. Miss Coffey also said this
prompted by another conservative MP who said supermarkets were still importing
too many products. It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms
that we have in this country. A lot of people would be eating termites right now
rather than thinking necessarily about aspects of lettuce and and and tomatoes
and similar but I'm conscious that consumers want a year round choice and that
is what our supermarkets and food and growers food producers and growers around
the world try to satisfy. Well we thought we'd turn to a turnip farmer and found
Richard Parry, farm manager of Home Farm in Nacton in East Suffolk. Only he
stopped farming turnips six months ago. I used to grow pretty well all of the UK
retail turnips. So I used to grow a lot of turnips. I'm currently not growing
any turnips as of about six months ago. Indeed people have coined you as the
turnip king and why have you? Once upon a time yes. And and and now no longer
the crown has slipped. Why are you not growing turnips? Predominantly struggling
to get hold of labour and the costs of growing the crop in and the value we were
getting in return from the supermarkets. Just explain when that started to
happen and and the the kind of impact that it's had on you generally. Three four
years ago it started to become a bigger problem and the last couple of years it
just become really tough. And you made the decision that it wasn't viable for
you at all to grow turnips anymore. It wasn't viable to to grow. It was hard to
get the labour to harvest the crops and and the other operations involved with
growing the crop and the consumption was steadily declining as well. So we
weren't getting sufficient volume to help keep some of our costs under control.
And what do you put that down to? The the lack of people being able to harvest
the crop and then the lack of demand? It's a lot harder now for us to source
labour. Traditionally, it was a lot easier to get labour through from Eastern
Europe. It is a bit harder now. There is now a source scheme, a seasonal
cultural wages scheme that is helping again, but the structure isn't as easy as
it was before. And people don't seem quite so willing to want to come over here
and work like they did five plus years ago. So when you hear the Environment
Secretary saying a lot of people would be eating turnips right now and you were
one of the people that produce those turnips, do you even think that that's true
that people are eating turnips as much as they used to? I don't think people eat
turnips like they're used to and it's not perceived as a as a sexy product like
some other things. And when you used to grow turnips, did you use to eat them
yourself? Yeah, I did. Yes. I used to cut them relatively thinly and fry them in
like a bit of garlic butter or something like that and sort of lightly crisp
them. So now you grow carrots and potatoes, sexier vegetables, potatoes, onions
and other vegetables. Yeah, they're the first of all vegetables that people have
a better comprehension what how to use them and and you know what they can do
with them and cook etc. but also from a farming perspective, they need a lot
less labour for the harvest or the operations of those crops as in seasonal
labour than something like a turnip or a salad needs. Richard Parry who used to
be the king of turnips. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought strong Western
condemnation and sanctions but there are many countries around the world who
have chosen not to join what appears to be a united front. Indeed, many have
balked at joining multilateral sanctions and have been reluctant to censor
Russia. As we were hearing on yesterday's program, Beijing continues to deepen
its relationship with Moscow and they've been joint naval exercises between
Russia and South Africa. India has been criticized by the US for a perceived
cleaving to Moscow and many Latin American countries have rejected the US
request to donate their aging Russian made military kit to Ukraine. I've been
speaking about the possibility of a new non-aligned movement emerging with Jorge
Haini. He is a former Chilean government minister and ambassador to China. He's
just co-written a book called the Active Non-Alignment Option. I began by asking
why Latin American countries are staying neutral in the war. The vast majority
of countries in Latin America and in Africa and Asia have condemned the invasion
of Ukraine by Russia. What they have not supported is the political and economic
sanctions proposed by the G7 against Russia and the efforts to make this what is
a European war into a global war. The war in Ukraine is a very tragic event but
it's certainly not the only war in the world. Its distinctive character is that
it takes place in Europe. When wars take place in Africa or in Asia somehow they
are disregarded. They do not qualify as having the same kind of significance
that is attributed to the war in Ukraine. And what countries in the global south
reject is the effort to make this into a global war and make them pay something
that Europeans should take care of. Isn't the fallout from Russia's invasion of
Ukraine a global war? Doesn't that make it a global war? The fact that we have
seen the price of fuel go up in the way that we have, that we've seen shipments
of grain being prevented from being distributed and so on. Many countries in the
global south have been profoundly affected by this war. Yes, of course. But the
notion that somehow applying economic embargoes and sanctions on Russia by
countries say like Brazil. Brazil imports one-fourth of its fertilizers from
Russia. It is a major agricultural exporter. So it satisfies its agricultural
production for the sake of supporting Ukraine in this European war. It is not
obvious that that should be the case. Moreover, the request by the United States
and by Germany for countries in Latin America to provide weapons to Ukraine
obviously pushes these things to the limit. That would mean that Latin America
would take an active part in a European war in which Latin American countries
have no direct interest and there's no reason why they should take part in it.
Do you not accept though that this is about the violation of the UN Charter
which is something that Chile has signed up to and many many countries in the
world have signed up to and that in the end this is about being on the right
side of history? Well, yes, I fully agree. I condemn the invasion of Ukraine by
Russia as do many countries in Latin America. Now there have been many other
invasions in the recent past. The war that we're seeing in Yemen which has cost
250,000 lives in the past eight years is being waged with weapons provided by
NATO countries to Saudi Arabia. Nobody has made a big fuss on that nor has
anybody proposed that global embargo should be imposed on Saudi Arabia. So it
seems to me there's very much a double standard here at play that because a war
takes place in Europe the whole world should be concerned and if wars take place
elsewhere well they don't matter very much. So you reject the rhetoric that has
been coming out from the West and the United States in particular and the US
President this week that this is really a war about autocracy versus democracy?
The fact is that some of the largest democracies in the world like India, like
Indonesia, like Brazil are not siding with the West. So this means that in fact
the cleavage that is being shown by the war in Ukraine is not one between
democracy and autocracy. Do you see this the invasion of Ukraine and the way in
which the countries in the global South are talking about this particular
conflict? Do you see this as the beginning of a new non-aligned movement for the
21st century? Very much so. There is in fact a new momentum for the rise of such
a movement and we are seeing it in Latin America and now also in Africa and in
Asia and this is also triggered by something that predated the war in Ukraine
and that is what we call the second Cold War that has arisen between the United
States and China and that means that many countries are being pressured to take
positions to side either with Beijing or with Washington and what we say is that
that should not be the case. The country should put their own interests front
and center and make decisions accordingly. Would you, would the people that you
are talking about in the global South back calls for a negotiated peace
including Ukraine, the country that was invaded, surrendering some captured
territory to Russia? Well what it seems to me what is becoming more and more
apparent there are two stances in the issue of the war there's one position that
is to continue the war as long as it takes to weaken Russia permanently. There's
another position that says that what must be done is to mediate and to look for
a peaceful solution. That is the position for example that President Lula of
Brazil has taken and that it seems to me is something that makes a lot of sense.
It seems to me that peace is a much more worthwhile objective than weakening
Russia permanently. That was Jorge Haini, a former Chilean government minister
and ambassador to China. Now according to mountain rescuers a fell walker is
lucky to be alive after getting lost in the Lake District. He was relying on
directions on his smartphone. The hiker had called for help at 6 30 p.m on
Monday but was not located until 2 30 p.m the next day and by then he was
hypothermic with knee leg and foot injuries. He was asked by the police to stay
where he was but rescuers were unable to locate him. The Wasedale mountain
rescue team said that they don't normally comment on rescues but said he was
fortunate to have been found alive and that Google Maps on smartphones are not
suitable for navigation on hills. They added that there was no substitute for a
map and a compass. So have we lost the ability to read maps because of our
reliance on technology? Is it in fact dangerous? Let's speak to Heather
Thompson, director of the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme for Southwest England.
The DOV scheme teaches young people expedition and adventure skills of course
among many others and Ross Cady is senior mountain safety advisor for
mountaineering Scotland. Welcome to you both. Ross Cady what do you think?
Dangerous to rely on the phone? I think it's a very good question and very apt
in this situation and I think it in this context if I was just to answer just
your very first question which is yeah if you're going to rely just on your
phone then absolutely it can lead to sort of issues but we're suggesting is you
don't just rely on your phone and there's lots you can do to back up your phone
and make sure it works properly if you are choosing to do that. Yeah I mean the
issue of the battery running out I guess is one thing but there is also the
issue of the kind of the lack of detail in a map on a smartphone that you
wouldn't have if you had a compass and a map with you. Yeah so mountaineering
Scotland did a survey of over 4 000 people and 87 percent of people 87 percent
said that they used some form of electronic device to navigate and of those 40
percent said they had issues and things so we've issued out some guidance in the
last sort of couple of weeks where if you're choosing to use your phone to
navigate then there are certain things that we're kind of advising that people
do to look after themselves and to make sure that if they're using the phone it
works in the way they're expecting and one of those big things to kind of come
back to the the issue that this is around which is the the mapping and the data
which is there are ways of downloading proper maps like that will look exactly
the same as a map on a paper map where you download it beforehand and then all
it is so like an ordnance an OS map an ordnance survey map yeah absolutely full
detail it you can zoom in it's actually really really good and it doesn't rely
on data it doesn't rely on any form of signal so it becomes a map on your phone
that you're reading so you still need to read the map and it's just on your
phone okay so that's the way around it let's turn to Heather Thompson the Duke
of Edinburgh expeditions are designed to teach young people how to do the very
thing that these rescuers were saying was absolutely critical in this instance
being able to read a map absolutely yes part of their expedition planning for
young people need to undergo training over a period of time and they need to
learn the basic navigation skills to read a map and use a compass and it's as we
would have seen this situation really important and it could could save
someone's life indeed so you appear to agree with the rescuers but i mean some
would argue that it's just sort of an outdated approach and that and that
perhaps it's a good idea to have the phone as well because one of the things
that you do when you send young people out on these expeditions is to take their
phones away from them um we don't take the phones away from them i'm sure most
groups actually do have a phone and and they're there for many situations
actually having a phone is very useful so we wouldn't necessarily advocate
taking them away but we ask them not to rely on them because of the very reasons
that they're not reliable and i think what's important is that young people can
sort of prepare and get themselves out of a situation should they need to so not
you know as you say nothing beats the actual physical map but the problem is
when you rely on a mobile phone as a gentleman is just saying they're very good
there's some very good applications on them but actually you need to be able to
adapt to the situations that you you that you're facing you know the weather
conditions can change very quickly and batteries in this cold weather that we
get um can can run out very quickly and you know and our Duke of Edinburgh
expeditions are really about giving young people that sort of independence
leadership and teamwork skills that we want them to develop um and actually
getting them away from the phone is is a wonderful opportunity for them to
experience the the great outdoors because that's what we want to engage to do
you both agree that that map reading is a is a skill that everybody needs to
learn how to read a map particularly when you when there aren't roads anywhere
Ross Katie yeah um yeah absolutely i mean i'm obviously an advocate for learning
to map read i spend a lot of my time teaching people to map read i think it's a
wonderful skill not just for hillwalkers and mountaineers but for everyone um
and it's a wonderful skill to have what we're saying is that um people are
choosing to use a phone to to navigate or to to watch their to look at their map
and we're saying if you're going to do that then there are certain things you
need to do to prepare for that just like if you take a paper map out in the
hills you've got to put it in a map case so it doesn't get wet i mean we've had
people that need rescuing because then paper map gets soggy because they didn't
do something right something that's very very basic heber Thompson we must all
learn how to read maps properly absolutely um it's a great skill to have and it
can stand you good stead you know at any point in your life you never never
might know when you might need it so we we definitely recommend it and we
encourage obviously all our our participants to do learn how to read a map so
it's a great skill to have heber Thompson director of the duke of edinburgh
award scheme for the southwest england and ross katie senior mountain safety
advisor for mountaineering scotland thanks for joining us both on the eve of the
first anniversary of the invasion of ukraine president zilensky has paid tribute
to all those who have died since february the 24th last year and in russia in
another message today to mark defender of the fatherland day the speaker said it
was time to celebrate the men and women who faithfully serve russia but not
those who have committed what he called the treacherous act of fleeing the
country tens of thousands have of course to escape last september's partial
conscription with rumors of more call-ups ahead of a spring offensive we're
going to hear from two men opposed to the war who avoided the draft but are
still in russia velodia is from buratia a region in eastern siberia he fled
first to the woods and then to st petersburg to avoid the draft he's now back in
his home village dima is 33 years old from moscow in september he hid in a
village a few hours from moscow to avoid being sent to ukraine to fight he's now
back in the capital the world tonight's james kumrasami asked him what he was
doing now many people feel deceived betrayed i feel mostly is that i didn't have
a say in matters for many many many years but now i feel like it's time to say
something i'm still thinking about joining novallnay's new resistance this is
alexa novallnay the the jailed opposition leader his organization his
organization yes anti-corruption fund as someone who opposes the war how are you
able to live at the moment what do you have to change about your life not
talking to people who obviously do support what's happening watching much less
social media because it's a battlefield of sorts focusing on my family right now
i'm focusing on finding a new job and when you look for a new job again do you
have to hide your views on the wall yes somewhere there is a mark about me being
a novallnay supporter i want to bring velodia in at this point um velodia tell
us a bit about yourself and your view of what's happening in ukraine it's
horrible it was a year of horror you can't even wrap your head around it most of
the time are you afraid that you will be called up for the war yeah you just try
to not think about it that much dima was saying that he switches off from from
social media from the news if you like is that something you felt you've had to
do as well yeah yeah of course it's it's almost a requirement if you want to
keep at least some of them wants of mental health you can't watch it all all the
time of the people that you are in contact with friends family colleagues how
many of them would you say feel the way you do about the war almost all of my
friends almost all of my close circle think the same thing as me they all
opposed the war half of my family opposes them too so it's something how have
you found it amongst your circle of of friends and and family opinions about the
war relatives in a region they support what is happening more in way of yes west
is bad and they're causing us trouble but we will prevail because it's a good
fight i wonder both of you whether you watched the rally yesterday at luzhny key
where president putin stood in front of this huge crowd with various members of
the armed forces alongside him whether you watch that and what you thought of it
when you saw it i'm still curious because his last speech i actually like
usually i wasn't angry i actually was somewhat enjoying watching it like what
are you talking about enjoying why why enjoying such a joke such a travesty
something surreal like he's living in a complete different story and world it's
an interesting way of looking at it i wonder velodia what do you think and do
you see the the rally at luzhny key the man is delusional it's kind of scary if
he really believes all of that all of what he's saying well then we have a
delusional man in charge of our army and our nuclear rockets and that's a pretty
scary thought i want to just end by asking you both about the future edema you
told us you're looking for a new job how about your your wife you've got a child
as well haven't you how are they doing it's terrifying but they stay by me they
feel like we can protect ourselves from the government and what about you
velodia in buryatia it's a region one of the regions i guess where more people
have been sent to the front lines than yet from the big cities like moscow in st
petersburg you don't feel more vulnerable to mobilization there if the second
wave actually starts i'll try to escape i go back to st petersburg because yes
this region was heavily targeted in the first mobilization it was pretty
gruesome and it was the time when i went to live in the woods for a couple of
weeks there was people walking down the streets and just catching all men that
look like they should be conscripted so it was nerve-racking so you would do
that again if you had news that new mobilization was coming you would just go
and live in the woods yeah i would either live in the woods or i would go back
to st petersburg and the government doesn't want to to raise concerns in big
cities velodia and dima speaking to james kurasami one closing headline 141
countries at the u.n general assembly have backed a call for russia to withdraw
its troops from ukraine immediately and unconditionally that's the world tonight
i'm resia ikbal from me and everyone else on the program a very good night the
studio engineers were alison percel davis and lee wilson the editor emily craig
eugene is going to tatiana's name day celebration in tonight's reading of eugene
on yegen by alexander pushkin that's coming up in a moment but now more epic
content closer to home continuing our celebration of the centenary of bbc radio
drama the huntsman now purposefully directed his footsteps analyzing the most
groundbreaking plays from the vast drama archive it's intensely physical this
room you can go to different places and tell the stories from different points
of view dramatic beats with me michael simmons roberts everything in british
storytelling on television owes so much to radio drama on radio four and bbc
sounds on saturday night at eight to 19th century russia now for pushkin's novel
inverse eugene on yegen some months after on yegen rejected tatiana's
declaration of love lensky persuades him to come to her name day celebration
assuring him it'll be a modest affair and lo with crimson hand aurora leads
forth from morning dale's the sun and brings in merry mood before her the name
day feast that's just begun since dawn dame laryn's near relations have filled
the house whole congregations of neighbor clans have come in dreys kabitkas
ritzkas coaches slays the hall is full of crowds and bustle the drawing room
explodes with noise with bark of pugs and maiden's joys with laughter kisses din
and hustle the guests all bow and scrape their feet wet nurses shout and babies
bleat then for a moment chatter ceases as mouths start chewing all around the
clink of plates and forks increases the glasses jingle and resound but soon the
guests are somewhat sated the hubbub grows more animated but no one hears his
neighbor out all laugh and argue squeal and shout the doors fly back two figures
enter it's lensky with yugene oh dear the hostess cries at last you're here the
guests all squeeze toward the center each moves his setting shifts his chair and
in a trice they seat the pair across from tanya there they place them and paler
than the moon dawn she cannot raise her eyes to face them and trembles like a
hunted fawn inside her stormy passions seething the wretched girl is scarcely
breathing the two friends greetings pass unheard her tears well up without a
word and almost fall the poor thing's ready to faint but deep within her will
and strength of mind were working still and they prevailed her lips more steady
she murmured something through her pain and managed somehow to remain all
tragico-hysteric moaning all girlish fainting fits and tears had long since set
yugene to groaning he'd born enough in former years already cross and irritated
by being at this feast he hated and noting how poor tanya shook he barely hid
his angry look and fumed in sullen indignation he swore that he'd make lensky
pay and be avenged that very day exalting in anticipation he inwardly began to
draw caricatures of those he saw but tea is brought the girls demurely have
scarcely taken cups in hand when suddenly from ballroom doorway bassoon and
flute announce the band elated by the music's bouncing his tea and rum at once
renouncing that paris of the local town's good potushkov to Olga bounds to tanya
lensky holly cover a maiden somewhat ripened glow my tamboff poet takes in tow
but yarn off worlds off pusty aqua then all the crowd comes pouring in to watch
the brilliant ballroom spin monotonous and mad procession young life's own
whirlwind full of sound each pair a blur in quick succession the rousing waltz
goes whirling round his moment of revenge beginning yugene with secret malice
grinning approaches Olga idly jests then spins her round before the guests he
stays beside her when she's seated proceeds to talk of this and that two minutes
barely as she sat and then their waltzing is repeated the guests all stare in
mute surprise poor lensky can't believe his eyes he steers her gliding
nonchalantly and bending whispers her gallantly some common madrigal to please
then gives her hand gentle squeeze she blushes in appreciation her prim
conceited face alight while lensky rages at the sight consumed with jealous
indignation he waits till the mizurkas through then asks her for the dance he's
due but no she can't what explanation well she's just promised his good friend
the next dance too in god's creation what's this he hears could she intend can
this be real scarce more than swaddler and turned coquette a fickle toddler
already has she mastered guile already learned to cheat and smile the blow has
left poor lensky shattered and cursing woman's crooked course he leaves abruptly
calls for horse and gallops off now nothing mattered a brace of pistols and a
shot shall instantly decide his lot though please with the revenge she'd taken
onyegin noting lensky'd left felt all his old ennui awaken which made poor olga
feel bereft she too now yawns and as she dances seeks lensky out with furtive
glances the endless dance had come to seem to alga like some dreadful dream but
now it's over suppers he did then beds are made the guests are all assigned
their rooms from entrance hall to servants quarters rest is needed by everyone
eugene has fled and driven home alone to bed the note was brief in its
correctness a proper challenge or cartel politely but with cold directness it
called him out and did it well onyegin with his first reaction quite kurtly
offered satisfaction and bade the envoy if he cared to say that he was quite
prepared avoiding further explanation zaretsky pleading much to do arose and
instantly withdrew eugene once left to contemplation and face to face with his
own soul felt far from happy with his role he could have shown some spark of
feeling instead of bristling like a beast he should have spoken words of healing
disarmed youth's heart or tried at least too late he thought the moments wasted
once more that dueling fox has tasted his chance to mix in this affair that
wicked gossip with his flair for jibes and all his foul dominion he's hardly
worth contempt i know but fools will whisper grin and crow so there it is the
mob's opinion the spring with which our honors wound the god that makes this
world go round convinced that auger's heart was cruel lademia vowed he wouldn't
run to see that flirt before the duel he kept consulting watch and son then gave
it up and finally ended outside the door of his intended he thought she'd blush
with self-reproach grow flustered when she saw his coach but not at all as
blithe as ever she bounded from the porch above and rushed to greet her rhyming
love like giddy hope so gay and clever so frisky carefree with her grin she
seemed the same she'd always been once more in solemn wrapped attention before
his darling auger's face lademia hasn't heart to mention the night before and
what took place it's up to me he thought to save her i'll never let that foul
depreva corrupt her youthful heart with lies with fiery praise and heated sighs
nor see that noxious worm devour my lovely lily stalk and blade nor watch this
two-day blossom fade when it has yet to fully flower all this dear readers meant
and fine i'm dueling with a friend of mine impatient but in no great panic
lademia waited near the dam meanwhile zaretsky born mechanic was carping at the
millstone's cam onyegin late made explanation zaretsky frowned in consternation
good god man where's your second where endules a purest doctrinaire my second
said eugene directly why here he is monsieur guillot a friend of mine whom you
correctly will be quite pleased to greet i know though he's unknown and lives
obscurely he's still an honest chap most surely zaretsky bit his lip well vexed
onyegin turned to lensky next shall we begin at my insistence behind the mill
without a word and while the honest chap conferred with our zaretsky at a
distance and sealed the solemn compact fast the foes stood by with eyes down
cast the gleaming pistols wake from drowsing against the ram rods mallets pound
the balls go in each beveled housing the first sharp hammer clicks resound now
streams of grayish powder settle inside the pans screwed fast to metal the
jagged flints are set to go behind a nearby stump guillot takes up his stand in
indecision the dualists shed their cloaks and wait zaretsky paces off their fate
at 30 steps with fine precision then leads each man to where he'll stand and
each takes pistol into hand approach at will advancing coldly with quiet firm
and measured tread not aiming yet the foes took boldly the first four steps that
lay ahead four fateful steps the space decreasing onyegin then while still not
ceasing his slow advance was first to raise his pistol with a level gaze five
paces more while lensky waited to close one eye and only then to take his aim
and that was when onyegin fired the hour fated has struck at last the poet stops
and silently his pistol drops he lays a hand as in confusion on breast and falls
his misted eyes express not pain but death's intrusion thus slowly down a
sloping rise and sparkling in the sunlight shimmer a clump of snow will fall and
glimmer eugene in sudden chill despairs runs to the stricken youth and stares
calls out his name no earthly power can bring him back the singer's gone cut
down by fate at break of dawn the storm has blown the lovely flower has withered
with the rising sun the altar fire is out and done in anguish with his heart
forsaken the pistol in his hand like lead eugene stared down at lensky shaken
his neighbor spoke well then he's dead the awful word so lightly uttered was
like a blow onyegin shuddered then called his men and walked away zaretsky
carefully then lay the frozen corpse on sleigh preparing to drive the body home
once more sensing the dreadful load they bore the horses knayed their nostrils
flaring and wet the metal bit with foam then swift as arrows raced for home
