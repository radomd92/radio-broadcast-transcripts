 Stay with us. Outlook is next. This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio
station. Coming up on Outlook, Guérec Soudé grew up on a tiny French island,
dreaming of adventure. I was going on sea on my own when I was like six, seven
years old. I had my boat and I was just going out fishing and my dream was to
cross the ocean. At 21, he decided to sail the world with just a chicken for
company. I was thinking to have a pet with me. I think about a hen to have fresh
eggs and I say, oh yeah. And when I stopped to Canaries Island, I met Monique
and we fell in love together. He and Monique ended up travelling for years,
visiting both poles. It was to be a harsh Arctic winter. I know I will have a
very hard experience to be stuck in the ice, in the middle of nowhere, with no
communication, with no sun for 70 days. It's very hard. That was when Monique
came into her own. Their story after this. This is Danielle Jaworowiecka with
the BBC News. Hello. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a world order based
on rules and humanity depends on how events play out in Ukraine. Speaking after
President Biden's highly symbolic unannounced trip to Kiev, he said Ukraine's
victory over Russia depended on resolve and he saw such determination in Mr
Biden. For his part, Mr Biden said America would back Ukraine in its fight
against Russia for as long as it took. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen
reports from the Ukrainian capital. President Biden arrived here by train like
all the other leaders who visited Kiev. The Americans warned the Russians at the
weekend that the visit was happening but tried to keep it secret at home.
President Zelensky welcomed his guest at a brief ceremony at his official
residence. Thank you very much for coming Mr President. It's a huge moment of
support for Ukraine. He said President Biden was visiting at the most difficult
time for Ukraine. President Biden responded with strong words of support.
Russia's aim was to wipe Ukraine off the map. Putin's war of conquest is
failing. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has ordered the
formation of a new territorial defence force, saying every man should know how
to handle weapons. His defence minister said the force should have at least
100,000 volunteers and be present in every village and town. Mr Lukashenko is a
close ally of Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russia to use Belarus as a base for
attacks on Ukraine. Rescue services in Turkey are again searching for people
trapped under rubble after a new tremor in the south-east near the border with
Syria. This is the same region where 46,000 people were killed two weeks ago by
a much larger earthquake. Officials say three people died and 200 were injured.
Some structures weakened earlier have collapsed, including a bridge. A spokesman
for Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said it had been
difficult when the tremor first started. It was very shaky. We hardly stood up.
It was very difficult. But in the camp everything is fine. We checked the tents.
Everybody was fine. We were expecting that. So right now we are expecting more.
So everybody should be more prepared about this. The number of people killed by
flash floods and landslides in south-eastern Brazil has risen to 40. Rescuers
are searching for survivors after record rainfall devastated a stretch of coast
in Sao Paulo state. President Lula da Silva has visited the worst hit area
around the city of Sao Sebastião. If each one of us works alone, we do less
work. That's why we need to stick together. That's why we need to share the good
things and the bad things, because together we'll be much stronger and we'll
recover quickly. You're listening to the World News from the BBC. Israel's
parliament has voted to push ahead with a highly controversial overhaul of the
judicial system proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's religious
nationalist government. Tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets
outside to protest against the plan. The opposition in parliament vowed to fight
for what it called the soul of the nation after the bill was approved in a first
reading. Two top Spanish transport officials have resigned over a botched order
for new commuter trains that proved to be too wide to fit through non-standard
tunnels in the mountainous northern regions of Asturias and Cantabria. Ana
Pissarro has more details. Two managers of the railway companies in charge of
the project have already been sacked since the oversized train scandal broke
earlier this month. The latest heads to roll are the boss of Spain's state rail
operator and the secretary of state for the sector. The minister for transport
apologised to the regions involved and said there would now be a delay of two or
three years for the new rolling stock. 31 trains costing nearly 300 million
dollars. While the government argues diagnosing the mistake in a design stage
will avoid financial loss, costs may yet rise. A United Nations torture
monitoring agency has cancelled a visit to Australian detention centres because
two states have barred unhindered inspections. New South Wales and Queensland
have refused permission for the panel to check some prisons and mental health
patient facilities. The Australian government said it was deeply disappointed at
the cancellation. Botswana says it has seen a big jump in rhino poaching. The
tourism minister told parliament that 138 rhinos were killed over the past five
years, though numbers dropped sharply last year. Official figures say just two
animals were poached in the five years to 2017. The minister attributed the rise
to continuing international demand for rhino horn, especially in East Asia. BBC
News. Hello, I'm Jo Fidgen. Welcome to Outlook, the place to come for excellent
company. Today, courtesy of French adventurer Guérec Soudé and a very special
chicken called Monique. She's a red-rued island from Canaries Island. So she was
speaking Spanish and now she learned how to speak French. So that's good. And
she's a very nice hen, very courageous and very adventurous. She most certainly
is. Together, Guérec and Monique sailed around the world. They crossed the
Atlantic, travelled to the North and South Poles, across to Cape Horn, back to
the Caribbean and home to Brittany on the northwest coast of France, to a tiny,
privately owned island called Ivanec, where this story begins, long before
Monique entered the picture. It's where Guérec grew up, in the only house on the
island and with just the sea for entertainment. This island make me, you know.
My parents got divorced when I was seven years old and I was living with my dad.
It's only one house, so it was my family house and my dad's house. And maybe I
learned how to swim before I could walk actually. And I was always in the water
and so I spent all my time on this island and I was going like on sea on my own
when I was like six, seven years old. I had my boat and I was just going out
fishing. And my dream since little was to have a boat and just to cross ocean,
to discover a new country, new culture. So just you and your dad on this island?
Actually it was just my dad and me and one of my sister. Actually I've got six
sisters, but I'm the youngest. OK, so just you and one sister and your dad on
this little island. I mean, your dad must have been a huge figure in your life
then. Oh yeah, he was. He was like my example because he was a very brave man.
He had a lot of character, he was very respectful to all the people and he was
always smiling, always happy. And he sailed before and he told me so much story
about sailing across the Atlantic. And this is why I want to do that after, you
know. So he had already sailed across the Atlantic? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was a
very good friend with a very good sailor in France called Eugène Riguedel. And
yeah, he showed me so much picture about this trip and I was just dreaming to do
the same when I was older, you know. You say you were out sailing by yourself
from the age of six. So, I mean, your dad must have had quite a lot of trust in
you, I'm guessing. Yeah, he had a lot of trust in me. He gave me a lot of
freedom. I don't know if I can say too much, but I remember my family, my sister
said to my dad, Oh, you must be careful to your son because you leave him on bad
weather, go out on the sea and something can happen. But he was believing in me.
I learned that. This is like a school for me and this is how I grew up and I
think I got a lot of maturity very quickly too. So, yeah, I think I'm very lucky
to grow up on this island and to have a dad like him. Guirec would go on to name
his sailboat after the island, but he had to buy one first and that meant making
some money, which he did, first opportunity he got. I was not good in school and
it was very hard for me to be focused on something. I had to be outside because
I was hyperactive. Yes, hyperactive. Yeah. Couldn't stop going. Yeah, exactly.
And that didn't change a lot actually from that. And when I was 18, I quit
school. I fly to Australia. I arrived there actually with no money at all. I was
sleeping on the street. I didn't know how to speak English. I didn't know nobody
there. And my dream was to make some money, to buy this boat and to learn how to
speak English. The beginning was quite hard and I did a lot of different jobs.
With my first salary, I bought a push bike for like a bicycle and I did all
south-west of Australia. It was a very nice experience. And when I was 20 years
old, I come back and I bought my sailing boat. So you buy a boat which you plan
to sail across the Atlantic solo in. Tell us a little bit about this boat, would
you? So yeah, I was looking for a boat, like a strong boat to be safe inside,
you know, because sometimes on the sea you can hurt like a container, you can
hurt some piece of wood. And so it was very important for me to have like a
steel boat. But the trouble of the steel is like corrosion, you know, the rust.
And when I buy my boat, I was thinking to make a good deal. But very quickly I
make some boats inside the hole because it was full of rust. And I start with
this boat in very, very bad condition. And all the people around me told me, no,
you can't go like that. Just not possible. It's just too dangerous. Maybe you
will sink. And so I start my trip with a boat in very bad condition and with
like no money and no experience on sailing actually, because I did a lot of
windsurfing when I was young. But I never sailed on my own more than maybe two
or three hours on this boat before. You'd gone out for two or three hours alone
on this boat and now you were going to cross the Atlantic and who knows what.
Yeah, this is true. And you know, when I start, I had no communication on board
actually. And if something happened, it was not possible for me to call anybody.
And I remember my parents told me, if something happened, can you call someone
to take you and to rescue you? I say, yeah, of course. No worry. Because they
know my boat was not in very good shape. And they told me, if something happened
in the middle of the ocean, can you call? Can you like make an emergency? And I
say, yeah, of course. And had nothing of that because I had no money to buy this
kind of stuff. So I had no communication on the beginning for the few months. I
wonder what your parents would have said if you'd been honest about that before
setting off. I don't know. But I didn't start with something very hard to
because my dream was to sail in ice, you know, like Greenland, everything like
that. But I was thinking to start from something quiet, easy. So this is why I
crossed the Atlantic after Canaries to Caribbean, because you've got the good
wind, with the wind pushing you, with the wind and currents. So you set off in
early January 2014. How did Monique come to join you on that journey? When I
start my trip, I was thinking to have a pet with me, to have a company on board.
And I was thinking to have a dog, to have a cat. But I was I was just telling to
myself, this is too complicated. And after a few weeks, I think about a hen, you
know, like a chicken to have fresh eggs. And I say, oh, yeah, this will be very
nice. And I asked some people around me in France, like farmers. And they told
me if the hen is stressful, you will have no eggs. So I was very disappointed.
And I start my trip on my own from France. And when I stopped to Canaries
Island, just before to cross the Atlantic, I met Monique and we fell in love
together. You met and fell in love with Monique. Yeah. And you thought, right,
OK, she can come. She can be my only company. Yeah, exactly. And she was very,
very brave, actually. And first day she make me an egg. And so we crossed the
Atlantic together in 28 days. And she gave me 25 eggs. And she was just free
working on the deck. And sometimes I had a little bit some stress because I was
I was steering the boat and on quite bad weather. I saw waves coming, no. And I
just saw Monique drifting from the deck. And at the last moment, she give a
small flapping, you know, with this wing. And she just she just stay on board
and she come back so wet. So she had good sea legs, did she? Oh, yeah, she.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, I can see the advantage of having a chicken on board in
that, you know, if she's going to lay eggs, you've got a fresh food supply. And
I guess if she doesn't lay eggs and you get fed up, she could always make you,
you know, another kind of meal. Yeah, exactly. Now I can say that. Yeah, in the
beginning, I say maybe I will hit her. Maybe she she will fall in the water. But
very quickly, she come a very good friend. And I was very close from her. And I
was laughing about her. And we share everything, how meal and she was coming,
you know, on my legs when I was steering the boat, when I was reading, when I
was sleeping. Sometimes I wake up, she was just so close for my face. That was
so funny. And so this this is why we decide to keep going. So, OK, those are the
benefits of having a chicken on board. I can see some disadvantages, too. For
example, a chicken is going to create a lot of unpleasant mess all over your
boat. When it's on the deck outside of the boat, it's fine. You know, you just
take a bucket of water. But when she does that inside the boat, like on your
computer, like on the food, that's not very nice. But it's also two mouths to
feed. Yeah, but she was eating some some feed, you know, so I'd feed on board.
But Monique can eat everything. And what was very funny, actually, when we cross
our first ocean, she was eating flying fish. Wow. So flying fish would leap into
the air. Yeah, like so. So like sometimes hundreds of flying fish, like just
flying next to the boat. And sometimes they're just coming straight away on the
deck. I was liking the flying fish. And sometimes it was like a competition
between Monique and me, who was the first one to get the flying fish. And she
was just much more faster than me. And she was winning most of the time. And she
eats the flying fish, still alive, straight away in this mouth. It was so funny.
Is it normal for a chicken to eat fish? I don't know. It was my first chicken,
actually. So I think she is very special. What's funny, too, like after the
eggs, was tasting a little bit salty and like fish was not bad, actually. What
about swimming? Did you ever check out whether Monique could actually swim? Yes,
not on the beginning. But when we crossed the Atlantic and when we arrived in
the Caribbean, in St. Barthes, I teach Monique how to swim. I teach Monique how
to surf, to windsurf. And actually, she does a lot of sports now. OK, I've got
some questions about that. So number one, how do you teach a chicken to swim? So
she likes so much water, actually. And when we were on the beach in St. Barthes,
she was coming in the water because she was following me all the time like a
dog, you know. I just take her on my hand and I pose like I drop her very slowly
on the water. And she was just moving this leg and she was just coming next to
me. And windsurfing? Yeah, and windsurfing, too. And surfing, actually. And she
likes very much the water. And I think it was very important for me to teach her
how to swim, because if from the boat she will fall in the water. And that
happened a few times after, actually. And she knows if she falls in the water
and she will wait for me somewhere, I will come grab her. Wow. So would she go
out on the surfboard with you? She didn't have her own surfboard, surely? No,
no, no, no. She was coming with me like on the big surfboard, like a stand-up
paddleboard. She always wanted me to take her in every activity I can. This
chicken sounds quite incredible, I have to say. Yeah, she's incredible. So you
cross the Atlantic, you find that, you know, very easy. And so you set yourself
a bigger challenge, which is to go to Greenland and spend the winter there,
frozen into the ice. Now, why did you want to do that? It was a dream, you know,
I've got so many dreams, actually. And it was a dream to sail to Greenland and
to be stuck in the ice. Yeah, in the middle of nowhere, far away from people,
and to be on our own, to be cut off from the world, actually. And this is what
we did. To be cut off from the world. You wanted no contact with the world.
Exactly. Yeah, no contact. It's good, I think, sometimes to just spend some time
for yourself. You've got no people around you, you've got no internet. And for
me, it was very important to be far away and to be on my own with Monique. You
arrive before the big freeze. So, you know, you've got time to stock up and
this, that and the other. Can you describe for us, as you're approaching
Greenland, your first sight of icebergs? Yeah, I remember the first iceberg we
see, like maybe one or two days before we arrived in Greenland, and the Aurora
Borealis. Oh, the Northern Lights. Fabulous. Yeah, Northern Lights. Yeah,
exactly. And so we arrived in the south of Greenland and the plan was to sail on
the west part and go north. We were so excited, you know, because we arrived
from far away with Monique. We started with no experience, with the boat in very
bad condition. And now we just arrived in Greenland, sailing through the ice to
this huge piece of iceberg. We just sailed in Greenland with still no
experience. And so it was just amazing to see the big mountains after weeks of
sailing. And the ice and all the animals. And it was so nice experience. And we
stopped in many villages to learn with the Inuit people. Actually, I had to be
careful because they never saw a chicken alive because in Greenland, 70% of the
year, the land is just frozen. So there are no chickens there. The only chicken
you will see, it's on a plate, you know, ready to eat. And so they eat
everything there. So I had to keep Monique very close from me. What did people
think of her? They were very happy to see a chicken. All the people want to
taste the eggs. And I remember some kids were a little bit scared of Monique,
actually. Because, yes, there are no live chickens. I think Monique may be the
first chicken to come in Greenland. I think she should have been a bit scared as
well because, you know, as you say, a lot of animals end up on the plate in
Greenland, including... You tried seal meat and dolphin meat for the first time
and probably the last time. Yeah, probably the last time. Yeah, exactly. Because
they don't have the same animals than us and they are far away from everything.
And like the nature, it's very hard. And the condition is very difficult. They
will catch everything they can to try to survive. And one of my first meals, I
was invited by Greenlandic people and they gave me exactly some dolphins. They
eat whale and seal too. But of course, I didn't want to eat that. But I had no
much choice and it was actually a good experience. But they have a lot of
respect for animals too. And with the seals, they will kill seals. But just
enough to eat and they will keep everything on the animal. They will keep the
skin to do gloves, shoes. They will eat the stomach. They will eat the eyes,
everything. You didn't eat a seal eye, did you? No, no, no, I didn't. But I
tried the liver. The seal liver. Oof. What was that like? Yeah, it's not so
good, you know, when you see what is it. They eat that straight away and it's
still a little bit hot. It's like candy, candy for them. They like that so much.
And dare I ask, what was the dolphin meat like? Yeah, a lot of grease and it was
very hard for me because when they told me it was a dolphin, I was like, oh no,
I can't do that, you know, it's just not possible. They were all watching me and
I said, okay, well, I had to be polite and I had no choice to eat that. A lot of
grease was not good at all. And of course, the other animal that was on your
radar that you were going to need to be aware of, at least were polar bears, you
needed to be prepared. So you needed a gun. Yeah, to make some noise in case if
a polar bear comes. Right, okay, just to make the noise. How did you get hold of
a gun? You know, it's so easy. In Greenland, it's the biggest island in the
world. There are only 70,000, maybe less people on the island. On the small
village around the coast, there are maybe 50, 100 people, 200. And on the small
village, there is only one shop where you can buy your food. And in the same
shop, you can buy a gun. And every people can buy a gun, actually. It is very
strange because you've got like the fruits and next to the fruits, you've got
the ruffles. So on the first village called Kokortoq in south of Greenland, I
was taking some food. And in the same time, I bought a gun to protect me. So the
winter is setting in, the ice is getting thicker. You need to go and find your
isolated spot to settle in for the winter. I mean, I wonder what the villagers
said to you about your plan of cutting yourself off completely. What was their
advice to you? They didn't understand too much why I want to do that, but it was
not easy to speak with them because they don't know how to speak French, of
course, and they don't know much to speak in English. So it was very hard for me
sometimes to have a conversation with them. I guess you don't speak Greenlandic.
No, not much. I had to learn a few words. How do you say hello? How are you? So
it's a hallo, hallo, hallo. So you can open a conversation. Yeah. So before you
set off then for your remote overwintering spot, you got a last chance to make
some phone calls. Your last phone call was to your father. What kind of
conversation did you have with him? I just told him, so this is like the big
day. So I'm starting my new adventure, my new life. I was waiting that since so
long and I was so happy and I know he was so happy. And actually the plan was to
my dad to come to see me after that. So maybe around June. And so that's it. And
actually at this moment I had a satellite phone and I was keeping a few minutes
to call him when I will arrive on the spot. OK, so you set off for this spot a
few miles away from this village where you've been staying. How did you feel on
arriving there? And like you say, this had been your dream. Did it feel like
that when you got there? Oh yeah. So I was a few hours from the first village
and I find a small bay there. I was thinking it was a good spot, but it was not
so much protected from the wind. I was so happy and I was waiting that since so
long and had to fight a lot to arrive. And for me it was a big accomplishment.
But I knew it would be very hard because I would have some maybe bad condition.
But from the first day I had a very bad news from a friend who arrived from the
village. So this was a villager you'd met in the village where you'd been
staying before. And this is the very first day, full day that you'd spent in
your winter spot. So he arrives by boat to tell you what? Yeah, so he arrived by
boat after a few hours of sailing. And I was very surprised to see him, but I
was quite happy, you know. And Uno tried to tell me something, but I didn't
understand what he wanted to tell me. So he come on board and he showed me this
phone and had a message of my sister. And when I read this message I just
learned from my dad just passed away the first day when I arrived on my bay to
start this new challenge. It was very, very difficult for me. I was not prepared
for that. And for me it was a hard thing I never have to live in my life
actually. We'll take a short break for the news, but when we come back we hear
how Girek, grieving for his father and struggling to deal with icebergs and high
winds and solitude, came to rely on his pet chicken Monique to keep him going.
This is Outlook. I was expecting people to hate me when I came back. People
welcomed me like I had just left the day before. You're ashamed of what you've
seen and what you did. I say this is the only thing that makes sense, me living
in Vietnam. I came back to fight the war. I kind of explain it as when you're a
little kid, you've got a monster under the bed, I had to look under the bed and
the monster wasn't there. No Place Like Nam, Saturday at 12 GMT. Coming next on
Outlook, Girek Sude is sailing around the world with his pet chicken Monique and
has just settled into the pack ice ready for an Arctic winter when he learns his
father has died. I had to turn my sadness into something positive and I was just
telling to myself, no, you're not on your own anymore, you're with Monique. How
Monique kept Girek alive through the dark winter months. After the news. BBC

Cantabria. And park keepers in New York have captured an alligator that was
spotted in a lake in Brooklyn. Hello, welcome back to Outlook. I'm Jo Fidgen.
We've been hearing about the extraordinary adventures of Guéric Soudé, a young
Frenchman who set off from Brittany in a rickety boat to sail around the world
with just a chicken for company, a Rhode Island red called Monique, who were
taken to the high seas like a natural. The two of them had made it to Greenland.
It had been Guéric's dream to spend an Arctic winter without human company or
communications, packed into the ice in the everlasting nights until the return
of the sun. On his last day in a village, he called his beloved father and told
him how happy he was. His father was very proud. And the very next day, a
villager sailed for hours to bring him the news that his father had died of a
heart attack. Conditions as they were, there was no way he could go home. I was
just too far away to come back to France. I had no choice but to keep going. So
I had to turn my sadness into something positive and make me stronger. And I was
just telling to myself, you're not on your own anymore. You're with Monique and
your dad is with you. You have to fight stronger now. When you say your dad is
with you, what did you mean? You know, he's in the sky, I say, so maybe he's
just next to me. He will help me because it was very hard for me. And, you know,
in this situation, you just want to be with your family. And for me, it was just
not possible. I know I will have a very hard experience to be stuck in the ice,
in the middle of nowhere, with no communication, with no sun for 70 days. And
it's the first day you learn that you just lost your dad. It's very hard, you
know. You said, you know, OK, I've got Monique for company, but Monique is a
chicken. I mean, I know that she had been a great companion to you, but how
could she help you in that situation? Because she was with me. I was speaking to
Monique all the time. And I'm sure she understood me and she was like, yeah, a
companion. She was like a pet, you know. And I think it would be very different
if she would be not with me. I was very happy to have her and to have these eggs
too, because actually on this trip, I only take some rice because I was thinking
to catch fish. But there was no fish at all. And so I survived because of the
eggs of Monique too. And yeah, she gave me a lot of love, we can say. So she
gave you sort of psychological support and kept you nourished. Exactly. Yeah,
she gave me 106 eggs in the 130 days stuck in the ice. And this was a chicken
you'd been told wouldn't lay because she'd be too stressed. And she clearly
wasn't stressed. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, I think she's the best chicken in the
world. And I think she's a more happy chicken in the world too. What did she
make of the extreme cold? So Monique had a cabin outside. And when we planned to
go to Greenland, I make a cabin inside the boat too. She had the choice to go
out or inside. But when it was very cold, she was inside the boat, of course.
How cold did it get? We had some time like minus 60 degrees Celsius. That's
icicles on your nose weather, isn't it? Yeah, it's horrible. You had to move
because if you don't move, you just freeze. You made Monique a jumper. Yeah, I
make Monique a jumper. Exactly. It was a Christmas present for Monique and I
make her a sledge. For Monique too, when the weather was not too bad, I take her
on the sledge. You went out sledding with your chicken? Yeah, exactly. You've
got quite a lot to deal with on this boat stuck in the ice, not least the
emotional things that you're going through, but also the very practical
problems. When the pack ice is breaking up, you've got icebergs appearing by the
boat, you've got terrible winds. You mentioned that the wind was really bad
where you were. Were you scared? Yeah, actually, yeah, we had very bad
condition. And sometimes the wind was just pushing the iceberg next to our boat
and had no visibility most of the time. I said before, 70 days with no sun, so
it was very dark. And so the boat was full of ice and had to break the ice all
around the boat every day. And it took me maybe two hours. It was very hard. And
we had a huge storm arrived and the waves were coming under the ice. And the ice
was quite thick, actually, maybe 40 to 60 centimeters. And after a few hours,
all the ice break like a huge puzzle. And the boat was like squeezing. I just
said to Monique, OK, now something will happen, not very nice. So we have to
take off some piece of wood from the boat to try to make a small cabin on land.
So I was on the dry suit with a tent, sleeping bag, like just ready to lost the
boat, you know. Ready to go and camp on land with Monique. And you managed to
avoid that? Yeah, we were very lucky one more time because after hours, hours,
the wind turned and the ice come out from the bay. And we've been on the water
again, on free water. I mean, you started out thinking this was your dream. I
mean, it sounds awful, frankly. Yeah, but I think this experience was a harder
and better one. It was so interesting, but very stressful because a few times I
was thinking to lost my boat and to lost everything. Including your life? Did
you think you might lose your life? Yes and no, because I always try to stay
positive, but I was not always sure about the end of the story. But we always
fight and yeah, we just try to stay optimistic. As you say, 70 days without
seeing the sun. What was it like to see the sun rising for the first time? Oh,
yeah, it was very, very nice. Oh yeah, I think we were crying. It's really, you
know, I hesitate to use the word sweet, but it does actually sound really sweet.
You always say we, you never say I. Monique is with you every step of the way,
huh? Oh yeah, yeah, she's part of the family. Yeah, we did that together. If I
would be on my own, maybe it would be very different and maybe something bad
will happen, you know? So yeah, we did that together. Yeah, it's more than a
chicken. She does sound like more than a chicken, I have to say. So after 130
days in that place, the ice breaks up, you're back on the open sea, you're off
around the north and west coast of North America, briefly imprisoned by Canadian
coast guards on your way for bringing a firearm into the country, this gun that
you'd got to scare off polar bears. How did that go? When we left from Greenland
with Monique, the plans was to do the Northwest Passage. We had to stop in
Canada. And when I stopped to a small village called Pointland, the customs
asked me some questions like, you've got drugs on board, you've got guns, you've
got animals. And I said, no, I don't have that, don't worry. They told me, okay,
we will come on board to check everything. And I said, oh, no. And when we
arrived on my boat, Monique was just working on the deck, you know, and had my
rifle inside the boat and they was not very happy. When you lied. Yeah, when I
lied, exactly. Yeah. They didn't like that you lied. Yeah, I think so. They
said, okay, now we will keep your boat and you have to go to jail. You know, I
said, oh, no, that's bad news. And after like six, seven hours, they take me out
from the jail. They give me someone on the phone and I told him I was, I'm not a
bad person, you know, I'm just a young French, strange man, you know. And he was
very nice and he told us, okay, you will go back on your boat with Monique and
we will give you back your rifle because we know it's very important to have
that in North Pole in case something happened. Why do you think they showed you
mercy in that way? Maybe they were thinking in the beginning I was maybe a
terrorist or something like that, you know. And they checked my website and they
see, okay, well, they are just a young man with his pet and they just want to
have fun and to destroy the world. So they said you're going to need this gun.
Did you actually see, did you actually come across any polar bears on your trip?
Yeah, yeah. We saw polar bear like swimming next to our boat, maybe one or two
metres, was just crazy. But I just keep Monique safe because I was thinking if
the polar bear saw Monique, oh, they will maybe want to test it. But you didn't
have to fire your gun? No, no, no, no, no, of course not. No, no, no. So you
continued on your journey and you did make it through the Northwest Passage
between the Pacific and the Atlantic. And the Northwest Passage is a pretty
terrifying sail, I'm guessing. And you became the youngest sailor to navigate it
solo. And indeed Monique the only chicken to go through it as far as anybody
knows. What is it like? So yeah, exactly. Monique being the first chicken who
did the Northwest Passage. So I was very happy about that. And yeah, the sailing
into the Northwest Passage was quite difficult because not much people going
there actually. And the charts are not very accurate. So maybe two times we
touched with the bottom of the boat and there are a lot of drifting ice too. So
sometimes you have to climb on top of your mast. You can fly your drone too to
see a small passage. What is hard when you sail like on your own, you have
nobody to steer your boat, you know. Monique sometimes come to help me on
steering, but it's not so helpful. I've got autopilot on my boat, but when
you're too close from the North Pole. When you're that close to the North Pole,
yeah. Yeah, the autopilot don't work. So you have no choice to stay outside and
to steer your boat. And so it was very, very difficult for me because I didn't
sleep with Monique. We did the Northwest Passage in 32 days, something like
that. And I didn't sleep so much on this trip. So sometimes I had hallucinations
on board. I was thinking there was people on my boat because I didn't sleep. So
I was just too tired. Continuing your journey then. So you sail all the way
south to Antarctica and from there to Cape Town and then north to the Caribbean
and finally back home to Brittany. I mean, this was a trip that you'd set out to
cross the Atlantic and you'd ended up covering 45,000 miles over five years.
Yeah. I mean, some marriages don't last that long and you've spent all this time
with Monique. Quite an adventure you've had together. Yeah, it was. Yeah, very.
Because in the beginning we didn't know so much where we would go, for how much
time we will take our trip. And we just want to keep going to, yeah, to discover
everything we can. And all the while, all through this journey, you're taking
all these photos and posting them on social media, getting a huge following,
people just delighted with what you're up to. But of those photos that you took,
do you have a favourite? If I've got a favourite? We saw so many nice things,
you know, like in the north we saw the polar bear, we saw whales. And in the
south, been to Antarctica to see the penguins. But I think one of my best
pictures, it's Monique working on the ice next to the boat in Greenland. I was
with my camera and Monique was just so happy to work on the ice. And actually it
was a little bit windy and she had the wind coming in her, on her wing and she
was almost like sleeping on the ice, you know? Sleeping on the ice. Mm-hmm. How
can you tell when Monique is happy? I know her, she's almost smiling, you know.
Actually, she's always happy, you know. Just one time she was not very happy.
When I left her, when I was in San Francisco, I had to leave Monique for a few
weeks and she was making a depression because she didn't see me and she was in a
bad mood. But when I came back, she was much better. Oh dear. What was it like
to get home to Brittany after that long, long trip? Well, it was so, so nice to
arrive after so much experience. And I was talking about Brittany to Monique
since the beginning and I was telling to Monique, you will see one day we will
come to France and I will show you Brittany, the island. You will love it, I'm
sure. How does she like the island? Yeah, she likes it so much. Now she's got
some friends too on the island and that's very funny because Monique sometimes
goes with her friends just on the beach to take the seaweed and to go almost
fishing, you know. So always close from water. This is a secret for Monique. And
when you say she's got friends, are these chicken friends? Yeah, chicken
friends. Exactly, yeah. And a dog too. And a dog too. And one other new occupant
of your island, your partner, who is about to have a baby. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Are you worried that Monique is going to be jealous of the competition for your
affections? I hope not. I think Monique will take care of her new baby, I'm
sure, about that and she will share all the story. You know, she's got so much
to say. Is she allowed into your house? Yeah, of course. And do you still go out
on the boat together? Yeah, we're still going out on the boat together. I just
came back actually from crossing the Atlantic on a rowing boat. But I didn't
take Monique with me because the boat was too small and it was too dangerous. So
I think now we can say Monique is quite retired on the small island in Brittany.
After all your years with her, getting to know her, do you have some chicken
wisdom to pass on? No, but what I say, if Monique did it, all the people can do
it. Live your dream because a chicken can live your dream. Exactly. Look what
Monique just did. So if you want to do something in your life, you just have to
fight for that. Try to enjoy and to keep going, yeah, fighting and to never give
up. How long could she live? They can live like for, it's hard to say, but I
think the average is 10 years, 13 years, sometimes it can be like 20 years
actually. So yeah, I'm very, very close from her and I hope she will live for
100 years. Guirec Soudé speaking to Outlook at the close of 2021. Soon

Ilona Toller. Today, I'm taking you back to the newly reunited Germany of 1991
and the vote to decide which city would become the country's capital. It's the
20th of June, 1991, and the German interior minister Wolfgang Schäuble is at the
makeshift government building, the Wasserwerk in Bonn. He's about to give one of
the most important speeches of his career. And then, about 45 minutes before the
session, I got myself a coffee and lit up my pipe. And I thought about how to
start my speech, because the beginning is the most important part. After World
War Two, when Germany was split into two halves, lawmakers decided that the
small and unheralded city of Bonn should become the temporary capital of West
Germany. And it stayed that way as it became clear that the division of the
country between capitalist West and communist East was there to stay. Bonn
thrived as the capital of West Germany, which underwent an economic miracle to
recover from the Second World War. The world looked at a small, modest Bonn.
Bonn's citizen, Jürgen Nimptsch, who would later become the mayor of the city.
Queen Elizabeth was visiting us, John F. Kennedy, Michael Gorbachev, and so on
and so on. A lot of people and the citizens of Bonn basked in the splendor. And
they did well because the federal government provided jobs, prosperity, and a
lively cultural life. Berlin, located east of the border, was separated in two
by the Berlin Wall. This giant scar across the landscape of Germany. Political
aggression and a pretty nasty piece of calculated inhumanity to boot. But in
1989, the fall of the wall made headlines around the world. Bulldozers breaking
holes in the Berlin Wall, the most sinister fortified border in the world. The
Iron Curtain opened. The city reunifying itself. The post-war order in Europe is
now collapsing. You're happy? Yes, I am happy. Marvelous. I think it's
marvelous. The end of the wall marked the end of communism in East Germany and
set the stage for reunification. But after so long apart, bringing the country
together was going to be very complex and would require immense political will.
One issue which is still dividing the country, which city should be its capital?
The contest is between Berlin, which was the capital until Hitler's downfall,
and Bonn, which has been the seat of parliament and government since 1949. Both
sides collected arguments. Many Germans thought that the former power center of
the Third Reich, Berlin, was not suitable as a political center of the new
democratic Germany. The residence of the Führer and Chancellor Adolf Hitler. The
case for it is its history. The case against it is also its history. So Bonn was
standing for modesty and democratic reliability, while Berlin stood for a view
of the state that was obedient to the authorities. Wolfgang Schäuble was an
unlikely ally for the Berlin side. He was a veteran West German political
operator and minister. Most West Germans supported Bonn, and they outnumbered
voters in the East. But Schäuble saw moving the capital as an important step in
successfully reunifying the country. You know how it is. As long as we're doing
well, we don't want anything to change. And that was the starting position for
the debate. It was suspenseful till the end. On the 20th of June 1991, a
decision was due by parliamentary vote, with a final debate first. And Bonn or
Berlin for the Bundestag? German parliamentarians vote today on their future
capital. Berlin's mayor Eberhard Tipken, he speaks as if Bonn's arguments will
prevail. They want to consolidate the Bonn Republic. I think that's against
history. The members of parliament from the northern and eastern Germany would
be predominantly for Berlin, and those from southern and western Germany would
be predominantly for Bonn. Of course, they had pre-counted how everyone planned
to vote, so they were pretty sure they would have the majority. The day became
quite an event in Bonn. Crowds gathered at the marketplace in front of the
historic town hall. We had a big screen with a live broadcast of the debate. We
were relaxed and said, at the end of the day, it would be Bonn. Up to this
point, Wolfgang Schäuble had not been expected to intervene in the debate at
all. But he surprised everyone by standing on the floor of the parliament and
making an impassioned plea on behalf of Berlin. A West German politician
publicly backing the East German city. This debate wasn't about Bonn or Berlin,
about West Germany or South Germany. It wasn't about regional interests. It
simply was about the future of Germany in a united Europe. Berlin is in the
middle of Europe, and that's why it is the only right place for the capital. The
reaction was immediate. His speech had struck a nerve. I immediately felt a
strong reaction from the MPs. At the end, the Berlin supporters got up from
their seats and gave me a standing ovation. Inside the Bundestag, it was clear
that many had been won over. The vote was now going to be very close indeed.
From Germany, where the parliament has just voted by 17 votes to move the seat
of government from Bonn to Berlin. Parliament President Ritter Süssmuth
announced the result and the market grew quiet. For a lot of people in Bonn, the
world collapsed. What can we do now? But, according to Jürgen Nimptsch, the
people of Bonn quickly adapted to this new reality, which he ascribes to the
character of the Rhineland, the area around the city. In Rhineland, we never say
it is like it is. We drink our beer, a Kolsch, or two or three or five, maybe
ten, and the next day we have to think about what we can do. A different Bonn, a
new Bonn. The Bundestag decided that Bonn would get financial aid to compensate
for the loss of jobs and investments. But that wasn't all. The United Nations
came to Bonn and now we are proud to be Germany's United Nations city. That fits
with our story. The structural change has done Bonn well. The government has
gone and the United Nations have come. Meanwhile, hopes that putting the capital
in Berlin would kickstart a revival of the East, which had lagged behind
economically under communism, haven't been fully realized. Inequality between
East and West remains a persistent problem in German politics. But Berlin's
status as the capital is a constant reminder of the fact that Germans never want
their country to be divided again. That was the right decision. Whenever I'm in
Berlin giving a speech, I tell Berliners to be more aware of their
responsibility as a capital. The beauty of it all is that today, this decision
is no longer questioned by anyone. Complaining is not our business. Everything
turned out OK for Bonn at the end? A few people say, oh, in former times, all
wars on a better way. But the world is changing and Bonn has to change too. I'm
proud to be a Bonner. Jürgen Nimptsch ending that edition of Witness History. It
