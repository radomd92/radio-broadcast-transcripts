police are linking dissident Republican paramilitaries with the attack it has
been condemned by local political leaders as despicable and cowardly the
Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton Harris has also condemned the attack and
called it a significant and serious event it was a cowardly and callous attack
that happened last night everybody in the policing community and actually the
community of Omar is completely shocked by this because society has moved on in
Northern Ireland there is no place for violence like this the Labour leader Sir
Keir Starmer in a speech in Manchester has revealed what he's called his five
missions setting out his party's objectives should it come to power at the next
election secure the highest sustained growth in the g7 growth that makes

health and care services to speed up treatment make Britain's streets safe break
down the barriers to opportunity at every stage for every child and five we will
make Britain a clean energy superpower secure said the pledges would be aimed at
tackling fundamental long-term issues as opposed to what he called the sticking
plaster politics of the Conservative government at the beginning of the year
which he soon exit out his own five promises including a focus on growing the
economy the number of asylum seekers waiting for a decision on their case in the
UK has risen to record levels with around 166,000 people in the backlog almost
110,000 have been waiting for longer than six months doctors at a hospital in
London have published guidance on how to treat the severe side-effects of
inhaling nitrous oxide after a surge in people admitted with symptoms over the
past year they're warning that laughing gas can cause permanent damage to nerves
in the spinal cord dr. Alistair Noyce who is a neurology professor at Queen Mary
University says there are a number of symptoms to be aware of in people that are
using nitrous oxide recreationally symptoms such as loss of sensation or altered
sensation in the legs or feet or hands difficulty walking falls potentially
inability to walk at all and also bladder and bowel complaints these are the
symptoms most commonly reported by the patients that we see the European
Commission is asking its employees to remove the Chinese short video sharing app
tick-tock from their corporate phones the EU's industry chief Thierry Breton
told a news conference the EU is very focused on cybersecurity but gave no
further details tick-tock called the decision misguided the football commentator
John Motsen has died at the age of 77 known to fans as Motti he covered 10 World
Cups and European Championships as well as 29 FA Cup finals during a 50-year
career with the BBC he worked on his final match in 2018 John Watson was known
for having a memorable turn of phrase the crazy gang of beaten the culture club
it's dramatic it's delightful it's Denmark who are the European champions John
Watson who has died at the age of 77 BBC News now on Radio 4 it's time for you
and yours with Winfred Robinson hello welcome to you and yours gap finders it's
a series we're doing with people who see a gap in the market for a new way of
doing things and decide that they can fill that gap today's gap finder is Tunde
Okewale he's the founder of urban lawyers it's a charity that helps young people
from poorer and ethnic minority backgrounds into the law if you have any
questions that you'd like me to ask Tunde Okewale please email them to me now
you and yours at BBC.co.uk and Tunde welcome to gap finders good afternoon thank
you for having me you're young you don't turn 40 until later this year yes you
were 20 you don't look it you were 27 when you started this charity urban
lawyers and then you'd only been a barrister yourself for three years what made
you want to start a charity so early on in your own career I felt compelled to
do so I feel that generally when you're fortunate enough to be successful there
is an obligation to be of service and for me that obligation was more apparent
because I was in spaces where I felt I was unrepresented and I'd come across
people that would ask me how did you do it and there in itself presented the
opportunity to fill in the gap showing people how empowering people and giving
them the opportunity so they feel they could compete and not be as insecure as
they might have done without necessarily having that skill set so the gap that
you were trying to fill it was for what information no so the gap I was feeling
was under representation and widening participation so in law people from poorer
social economic backgrounds and minoritized groups are often at a disadvantage
because there is a knowledge gap a resource gap a network gap and there is a
culture of soft skills and etiquette that they aren't necessarily taught when
they're going through the schooling system that those from traditional
backgrounds are and what I decided to do was to create an organization that
provided opportunities events and programs that gave people that access to
participate and pursue a career in law as the organization is developed we have
widened the work that we do and it attempts to make the law more accessible in
all of its facets tell me how you got it off the ground then there you were you
were 27 and the first thing I did is I went back to all my old schools so the
first thing I did is I went back to my old schools and I shared my story I spoke
to all of the students and the staff and told them about my journey into law and
told them about the difficulties that I faced and I was there to help if anybody
was interested in pursuing a career in law what happened after that was that a
lot of students were inspired to say they wanted to help me and that's how the
team started to form because in its first iteration the organization was just
called urban lawyer in the singular and it became apparent to me that if I
wanted to fill the gap and help as many people as possible I could only do that
with a team and then the organization became pluralized and it became urban
lawyers do you employ anybody now on the charity no so our next objective is to
have employed staff we're fortunate enough that all of the volunteers are legal
professionals that have full-time paid jobs and there are a number of students
who are going through the training but at this stage no tell me them practically
how you help because gosh that is one big gap you were trying to fill I mean
let's list that again I said was it information but it's much more than that no
it's much more than that but the best way to do it is perhaps through an
illustration of some of the projects that we do so for example we have a project
with the fashion brand Manolo Blahnik which is called the in-law program and
that program works with kids in year 10 and year 11 and develops their soft
skills so we'll give them skills on branding presentation they'll also be given
workshops around CV and interviewing so people will come in give them mock
interviews give them tips and advice they then have an immersion day where they
get to go into a solicitors firm get to speak to all members of staff so not
only the solicitors but everybody involved in the operational process of the
business they do the same thing with a barrister's chambers and then they get to
see how lawyers work within the framework of a business too and that's a seven
module project program and that targets schools that aren't necessarily doing as
well as others in poor areas so that's one example the second example is that
we'll work with law firms so we have an event in two weeks time with a law firm
called Decartes and they're keen at identifying students from non-traditional
backgrounds who wouldn't necessarily have the opportunity to obtain a training
contract for those listening that are not familiar with the phrase a training
contract is what's required for you to qualify as a solicitor it's akin to an
apprenticeship that you need to formally complete the process of training so
we're going to have an event with about a hundred young people who have gone to
non Russell Group universities state schools who wouldn't necessarily feel that
they'd have an opportunity to be a law firm and they'll get the tips and advice
that they will need so they can apply in future and have the confidence to feel
that they can pursue a career in law just tell me back to the thing that you
said that is sponsored by Manolo Blahnik so did they pay for all of that for
that project yeah and they contribute to some of it and Decartes do they just
put the other project on do they fund that they funded that you're a big name
now in the legal world for urban lawyers I suppose primarily you've got an MBE
for services to the community and to disadvantaged communities you're on the
Sunday Times alternative rich list of people who have enriched other people's
lives now you don't just do urban lawyers you also do other voluntary work or
the community roles your patron for example of the Hackney Law Center are you
also a successful barrister I'd like to think so I'd like to think so I like to
say to people there's no such thing as balance there's just work-life choices
and work-life consequences so sometimes there are instances where there are
things that I'd love to do with the charity but I don't have the capacity to do
it because I have to work and then there may be moments where I'm unable to work
because I have to focus on the charity so it's not a scenario where I'm
balancing everything at the same time and doing a great job everything at the
same time unfortunately no there are work-life choices and consequences and it
means that at certain junctures in my life I have to prioritize one over the
other you're a criminal lawyer aren't you yes okay we ask all our gap finders
this looking back at what has happened with urban lawyers since you set it up
what would you do differently has there been a big mistake I think the biggest
mistake that I made with urban lawyers and it's bizarre because it depends on
how you perceive it is perhaps having it volunteer based for so long and not
seeking funding and having employed members of staff because it'd make it much
easier it is something that I am exploring this year actively to assist with the
growth of the organization but had I done that sooner perhaps the impact that we
would have had would have been greater it's 12 minutes past 12 you're listening
to you and yours gap finders on BBC Radio 4 I'm Winifred Robinson coming up
after this program is sliced bread presented by Greg foot and it looks at the
claims that are made about different products today it's about hair conditioners
and heat protectors are they worth buying if you miss it sliced bread is on BBC
sounds and so are all the episodes of you and yours including gap finders on
this program our gap finder today is Tunde Okowole he's the founder of a charity
urban lawyers that helps young people from poor and ethnic minority backgrounds
into the legal profession Tunde let's talk about your own background then you're
the oldest of four children you grew up on a council estate in East London your
parents were immigrants what was your childhood like amazing so I'd like to say
that I was very fortunate in a sense that although we didn't necessarily have
the most money my family were very loving they still are they are responsible
for my success and keeping me grounded today and most importantly they had high
expectations of me so even when I entered areas spaces where there was a soft
bigotry of low expectations my family reminded me that I was capable of
achieving great things and they still to this day push me to fulfill my
potential you use that phrase soft bigotry and you have talked about that being
what holds people from disadvantaged backgrounds back what exactly do you mean
by that soft bigotry so the soft bigotry of low expectations in the context that
I'm using it refers to micro aggressions insensitivities where people knowingly
or unconsciously impose limiting beliefs on people from poorer backgrounds and
minoritized groups purely based on their own misguided belief that those
individuals are not capable of achieving certain things to give me an example of
how that's happened to you so growing up in school a lot of the young black
males were encouraged to pursue careers in sport I initially wanted to be a
professional athlete I didn't have any aspirations to pursue a career in law and
I'm not sure whether or not that thought or desire was something that I had or
one that was passively programmed to me and it's something that we see to this
day where people are encouraged to pursue careers I'm not being disparaging
towards careers in sport or entertainment but there are so many opportunities
and people shouldn't necessarily be guided softly through misguided intentions
that they should pursue one career over another based on someone's belief that
someone is not capable or able to do something do you think it's that when you
go to a school in a poor area none of the children know anyone who's a barrister
none of the teachers maybe know anyone who has ever been a barrister so people
choose or suggest careers that they have seen and understand I wouldn't use that
as an excuse it might be an explanation for the behavior but it doesn't justify
it because just because you don't know anyone that's done anything doesn't mean
that you should then transpose that limiting belief on to people that you're
supposed to be inspiring to be the next and best generation I'll give an example
we have a program that we're launching at the end of the year where we are
sending barristers into schools for that very reason so there's a barristers
chambers that we're working with called for PB they do predominantly family law
their barristers will be going into schools in and around London for the
remainder of the year trying to dispel that myth just in case there are teachers
reinforcing this soft bigotry of low expectations what teachers should be doing
and what school should be doing is seeking opportunities and ways to raise the
aspirations of the students that attend there the very purpose of the whole
educational system should be empowering young people and not necessarily
limiting what their opportunities are there should be these as what this is
what's available for you and if we can't assist let's find someone who can were
you clever at school define clever okay did you get good exam results did you
get good enough exam results to get into a Russell Group University I didn't
know but I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to being clever at the time where I
was doing my undergraduate studies I was undertaking a number of part-time jobs
and I didn't necessarily allocate as much time to my studies as I should have
done and that is a common occurrence for a lot of people from non-traditional
backgrounds they have a number of competing commitments and responsibilities
which means that they can't necessarily give themselves fully to their academic
studies it's not easy to become a barrister isn't even easy to find out how you
become a barrister so how did you manage it then without a first from a top-
flight University without any connections without any bank of mum and dad to
help you out it was very difficult I asked myself that same question sometimes I
was fortunate at every stage of my career and even now to find at least one
person that believed in me and saw that I could actually do it so the first
person that believed in me was a lecturer at University called Edwin Shorts and
him giving me that belief was enough because he then directed me to someone else
he might be able to assist me and I feel that one of the things that people who
don't necessarily have the grades or have the background need to do is be very
clear about where it is that they want to go and I use this analogy in a sense
of success in journeys generally if I was to get out of a train station ask a
stranger where's where's the nearest building the stranger would look at me a
bit bizarre but a lot of people approach their careers and life in that way
where they want to go somewhere but they're not necessarily clear about where
exactly is they want to go if you're pursuing a career in law the more specific
you are the easier it is for you to I find someone who can direct you and show
you how to get there or for you to create your own map and navigate your own way
to get there so that that's how I did it and in terms of law I just asked I
asked for help I got my first work experience by asking a colleague in
Sainsbury's if they knew anyone that worked in law and funny enough their
friend's dad was a barrister and he gave me my first opportunity gosh so it was
as random as that well I'd say more intentional because it was something that
I'd been doing for a long time and he was the only person that said yes no what
I mean is there was no structured sorry what I imagined I imagined that maybe
you had done your pupillage you know with a some kind of a bursary from one of
the big chambers no I mean random in the sense that you just asked a friend who
happened to know someone no no no no so that gave me my work experience so after
I had work experience you still have to apply for pupillage which I did so I
applied for pupillage I had multiple rejections I only had one interview once I
got that that interview I did a good enough job for them to give me a chance so
the only reason I made the reference to my friend's dad is that he gave me my
first work experience for me to get into the profession and you need work
experience as part of the application process for you to get in because you need
to provide evidence that you know what a barrister does and that you are well
informed about what it takes to be a barrister I'm told that a lot of the law
firms just throw off the pile of applicants anyone who didn't get a first do
they still do that no I think that if that was the case in the past law firms
and barrister chambers are moving towards finding the best talent and they are
finding different and alternative ways and I'd like to say that as a result of
organizations like urban lawyers we're not the only organization that
contributes to the problem and law firms and barrister's chambers now are
actively trying to find the best talent a lot of work still needs to be done but
there still does there does need to be recognition that some progress has been
made. Well we ask all our Gap Finders to nominate someone who has their back and
you chose your friend Daniel Ashfield-Louisey now he is a star in his own right
he's an entrepreneur he owns a construction waste management and concrete supply
company Asheville Inc and he has his own YouTube channel with 200,000
subscribers his weekly videos get hundreds of thousands of views worldwide and
they are very funny and Daniel we've been watching them all morning they're
quite addictive I've seldom enjoyed my research so much so tell me how did you
and Tunde meet? Hi firstly thanks for having me. Tunde and I met through a
mutual friend who was friends with Tunde and I believe Tunde had also done some
work with him and I'd like to point out that when Tunde and I met he at first he
didn't like me. Why not what didn't he like about you? We didn't actually have
an interaction and I was running around with a lot of energy and I always say
Tunde is the best-dressed man I know and I walked in I walked into the place
where we were going to be recording and I saw how well-dressed he was and he was
a barrister so with my tomfoolery I just kind of carried on with it and I just
assumed that he didn't want to be involved but after that we went to an event
together and actually sat down and have had a conversation and I'm happy to say
now he's one of my best friends and closest advisors. So how close are you how
much do you see of each other how often do you talk? We tend to talk every day
or every other day. Really? Yeah but we have very busy schedules so when we we
can't often meet in person so we call it the download so we do a download and
reboot so we call one of us goes first we talk about everything that's happening
one will make a couple of comments and suggestions and then we'll vice versa
then we'll change and we'll do it the other way which I I find very helpful. Why
do you think Tunde chose you as the person who has his back? I think that we
inspire each other I look at how hard Tunde works and we we have special things
between us that people don't understand like we we have this thing where we like
to catch each other out in the morning if one can message the other one and the
other one isn't awake yet that means that you're slipping so we'll be what's up
in each other at 4.55 you would sleep and he'll message me back and say don't be
silly. What's the best piece of advice you have ever given to Tunde? The best
piece of advice I've ever given to Tunde? Well I'd say well I believe it's the
best piece of advice but I'm but I'm not sure it is the best piece of advice I
believe the best piece of advice I've given to Tunde is that he should be a
judge. I believe he has the capability and as a close friend of mine I would
love to see him as a judge and I think he'd be a fantastic judge but he has so
many options in his life and he has so many different routes he can go down he's
focusing on so many areas I'm not sure if that's the path that he's gonna take
at the moment. What would you say is the best piece of advice he's ever given
you Daniel? The best piece of advice he's ever given me, wow. Smarten up
obviously in your dress. Yes, yes, yes, dress a little bit smarter, dress
accordingly. And once again it's probably something that people are gonna people
gonna say that sounds a bit strange but Tunde has a way of taking situations and
breaking them down and making and giving them to you so you understand them and
they're relevant to you. So I'm a massive Marvel fan and I was having a bit of
problems in my business I was having a few problems with my mental health and
Tunde sat me down and he said to me Daniel imagine yourself as Thanos you
haven't collected all your stones you had your stones and you've lost them we
need to get back your stones one by one so we can fully charge you back up to
your previous power. Sorry is that a classical illusion Thanos? Yeah it's it's
one of the it's a superhero. Okay sorry. In order to be a full power he has
different stones he has to collect. Okay. And when Tunde broke it down to me
like that I said you're right and then in my head I started to break down I need
to do this I need to do this I need to do this and I'm happy to say it made a
massive difference to my life you know my mental health my physical health
everything and I can't thank him enough. We always ask the person who has the
person's back you know what they worry about if they think of them you know if
you think about Tunde you think about having his back you think about protecting
him what worries you about him anything? I would say what worries me about him
is the same thing that would probably worry him about me we have a lot of jests
that well I'm never sleeping I could know but we're messaging each other
ridiculous hours of the morning and the night and I've never found a time when
Tunde is actually sleeping or resting and having downtime and like me vice versa
so he has all the capability in the world and he's gonna achieve fantastic
things but I just worry sometimes about how much is on his plate and that
possibly he may need some downtime sometimes but then he would turn around and
say the exact same thing to me and I would say not required so you know. Okay
Daniel, Ashford, Louise thank you so so much for coming on and Tunde at the
start I asked our audience if they had any questions for you and they do have
some questions well there's some fan mail coming in I'll just give you an
example David Long in Suffolk says today's Gapfinder is the most inspirational
person I have ever heard on your program and there's a question from Keith
Smeaton he says do you Tunde think it's harder for poor and disabled people to
get justice? Solicitors fees are high and it's become harder to get legal aid.
Yes I think unfortunately it is harder for them to get justice but it shouldn't
discourage them from seeking it unfortunately we haven't created enough
opportunities and initiatives to remedy that but you know you may have inspired
me and given me an idea to think of a new project. Tunde we ask all our
Gapfinders this one as well I asked you you know about your biggest failure
biggest regret with urban lawyers and you said not having paid staff sooner what
would you say has been your biggest success with it? My biggest success of urban
lawyers is urban lawyers like being it's going to be its 13th year in September
the fact that it's it's still running despite all of the various changes in the
legal system and in the world generally I think the biggest success is it's
still running and that the people make it successful so although I'm here as the
founder and the brainchild of it without the volunteers and the people that give
up their time and that support the organization it wouldn't exist. Your own
website says that you've helped 7,000 young students get on the career ladder
into law. I need to update that, it's more than that. How many would you say?
I'd say at least double that easily. Okay so you've been going for 12 years
7,000 we worked out would have been just under 600 a year so it's it's over a
thousand a year. Yeah. There are an awful lot of great charities that struggle
to keep going because the money is never secure is it? Are you financially
secure? If you're offering me more money I will take it happily. I would never,
Urban Lawyers is I wouldn't say financially secure because we get drips and
drabs in from organizations that want to work with us and that choose to fund us
but the reason why we've been so successful is that we don't rely on it so a lot
of the events and initiatives we've done haven't had any funding and that's
that's been part of the reason why it's been able to go on for so long because
we haven't been reliant solely on funding and sourcing funding so we don't have
complained about it in some ways it's been beneficial to us. Being in the legal
profession surrounded by barristers some people say that rich people don't give
money away it's poor people who give their money away rich people give their
time away is that true? No I think that we should avoid broad generalizations
about rich and poor I just feel that some people are very generous and some
people are not some of them happen to be rich and some of them happen to be poor
I don't think that you know if you you found like ten poor people they're all
gonna necessarily be more generous than ten wealthy people I feel that people
tend to be generous towards things that they're passionate about and that you
can identify with and I tend to find that and a lot of times people for oh my
god you're not generous but if someone can't identify with a cause or they don't
necessarily feel passionate about it then they're unlikely to support it. We've
just got a few seconds left so just a few sentences is there another gap you'd
like to fill another thing you're desperate to do? Yes but I need to finish my
work of Urban Lawyers first. Okay that's for another program Tunde Okewole
founder of Urban Lawyers thank you so much for coming on thank you. Today's
producer was Tara Holmes the studio manager was Jonathan Esp. Sliced Breads
coming up next Greg Foot rinses out the claims around hair conditioners and heat
protection products can they deliver smoother shinier hair and can you prevent
heat damage with styling so find out next. Hello I'm Greg Foot and welcome to
the show that investigates your suggested wonder products to find out if they
are indeed the best thing since sliced bread or marketing BS and gosh have there
been a lot of requests for this one listener Jenny emailed sliced.bread at
BBC.co.uk to say after your shampoo episode please please make one on
conditioner well Jenny here it is we got a bunch of whatsapp voice messages in
two on 07543 306 807 here is Katie Singleton in Kenya Hi Greg so I was washing
my hair after your fabulous shampoo episode and I wanted to know what is the
actual point of conditioner and what does it do to your hair you get all sorts
of different things promised on the different bottles like volumizing or
softness but do they actually do anything and there are lots of leave-in
conditioners and leave-in treatments so are they better than the ones that you
would use in the shower and then rinse off thank you. And to add something else
into this investigation here's Franziska Wettstein from Switzerland. Hi Greg I
was wondering could you also maybe look into heat protection products I was
wondering about those what is actually in them and do they give our hair any
protection against heat at all and if so is there a difference depending on what
sort of product you use like for example a cream or spray thanks for looking
into that and I look forward to hearing what you found out. So two types of hair
products under the microscope today conditioners look to normally cost around
two to four pounds a bottle the leave-in ones seem to be double that though and
heat protection sprays and creams I saw on sale for around seven to eight pounds
I did however see a conditioner and a heat protection oil each on sale for
almost 30 quid are they worth it well let's find out I'm gonna call up the same
two experts from the shampoo episode starting with a trichologist from the
Fulham scalp and hair clinic Eleanor Richardson Hello! Good to see you again
you're back in the storeroom. I'm back in the storeroom. Amazing so when we
spoke last time we were speaking about shampoo this time it's all about
conditioner yeah you told me last time that the hair grows out of the hair
follicles that are in our scalp that it's down to genetics how it grows the
shape and the curl of the hair shampoos job is to clean that hair what's
conditioner used for so conditioners have been brought in to basically help our
hair last for as long as possible in the best condition possible the action of
conditioner is to deposit onto the hair so very different from shampoos shampoos
are all about lifting off removing debris dirt oil but conditioners their role
is to deposit on conditioning agents and they are there to help smooth down that
outer layer of the hair shaft that cuticle layer that we talked about before
yeah yeah you explained those really nicely as well you said they're like slates
on a roof and that those slates can open up a bit say if your hair is curly or
if those cuticles become damaged moisture can be lost conditioning agents
deposit really well and fill in the gaps where we've had little bits of damage
or cracks to the cuticle and that essentially allows us to have the smoothest
outer layer of the cuticle possible which isn't losing moisture but also isn't
causing things like friction and therefore tangles so if different types of hair
are more prone to losing moisture for example curly hair do you need different
types of conditioner for those different types of hair I would say yes the
difference you're kind of looking for is a richer amount of conditioning agents
in the hair but as a result of that you may find that the hair has got more slip
to it which a lot of people will be looking for if however we used it on a
European head of hair which is quite fine quite thin you're gonna find the hair
feeling quite greasy very quickly so it isn't a case of the more conditioning
agents in your conditioner the better too many conditioning agents means that
the volume that we see visually is reduced a little bit so hair lies flatter
smoother slipped because listen to Katie wants to know about some of these
claims that conditioner making on the bottle and one of them is volumizing but
it sounds like if you use too much it's gonna be the opposite so a volumizing
conditioner will probably be a conditioner that actually doesn't contain too
many conditioning agents in it to begin with so what about those other claims
can conditioner leave your hair shinier can it leave it softer how is it doing
that it just sounds like it's covering the hair follicle and everything's
slipping around easier I mean you pretty bang on the money there Greg so let's
break it down straighter hair that has been undamaged and has a really smooth
cuticle layer on the outside of it is gonna reflect light the best and it's
gonna look shiny probably without much effort to be honest the curlier the hair
the less easily it's going to reflect light well and so to a degree you're going
to have some hair types that are never gonna look shiny and to try and persuade
them that a product can make it shiny is is to persuade an awful lot now how
much should we use because in the shampoo episode it sounded like we should all
use less shampoo was your advice and how long should it be on the hair for so
most people if they've got any bit of sort of color damage any bit of heat
damage or they're using color and heat regularly they want to be applying the
conditioner to the areas that have been damaged right or have had that exposure
so if you've got color from the roots all the way down to the tips I would be
conditioning the whole of the head of hair if you have only had no color to the
hair you rarely use heat but has quite long you've got old hair mainly towards
the ends of your hair that have just had generally more wear and tear so they're
gonna need a bit more help so I would say focus mid-length downwards but with
any conditioner you should be able to sort of put it all over the hair be able
to rinse it off and it not cause any damage but if you want to save money on
your product put it where it's needed put it where it's needed exactly something
else that listener Katie want to know is whether the leave-in ones work better
than those that you rinse straight off in the shower one of the leave-in
products even says stop rinsing the goodness off should you do that should you
stop rinsing the goodness if a product has been designed to be rinsed off rinse
it off but would you get more benefit from a leave-in conditioner because it can
be in contact for longer than a rinse off conditioner not necessarily if your
hair is particularly damaged and you're noticing that it is prone to dryness to
tangling to breakage that's when actually a leave-in conditioner can really
provide some extra support on the in-between days when you haven't washed your
hair equally if your hair is prone to frizz so it's prone to taking in moisture
leave-in conditioners can provide a little bit of basically a film coverage to
reduce the chance of that moisture coming into contact so they reduce the chance
of frizz occurring okay so for people with those types of hair it sounds like
you'd recommend a leave-in conditioner over a rinse off one I'd be working with
both of them so I'd still be conditioning on my wash day but I'd be topping up
with a leave-in one product made what I think is a fair point they say using
their leave-in conditioner rather than a rinse off one saves a lot of water I
guess but a lot of people use them in conjunction right so they're not
necessarily discounting a wash day by using leave-in conditioner so I don't know
it's a nice idea and now listener Francisco wants to know about heat protection
products you've mentioned heat being problematic in fact last time you said it
was the number one thing that damages our hair especially those cuticles our
first line of defense tell me more about what he actually does and tell me about
these heat protection products what are they what do they do so with heat being
applied to the hair you are temporarily breaking some bonds in that cortical
layer that middle layer in the middle of the hair shaft equally if we're using
heat we are also putting a lot of pressure on that outer cuticle scale as well
imagine any material if you apply a lot of heat to it it's going to start to
struggle it's a natural material ultimately so we're not heat proof we do catch
fire and so will hair quite literally it will start to burn if that heat is too
high so I believe that's why these heat protection products have been developed
the big kind of confusion I think with these products is that they're providing
ultimate protection from heat but in reality what we see is that heat protection
products tend to just reduce the amount of damage that occurs it doesn't reduce
the damage 100% so are they like oven gloves you know when you grab that bacon
tray but you still feel some heat and if that heat's gonna cause damage you're
gonna get minimal damage rather than maximum damage exactly so the quality of
the heat protectant is gonna dictate how much protection you actually have but
remember we're humans as well so we have to apply that heat protection and if
you're not applying it evenly and it's not spread throughout the areas that heat
is applied you're still gonna get damage and on the flip side you want some of
that heat in order to style your hair yeah if you want to change how your
natural hair texture is when you're styling it and your advice I'm sure would be
don't use the heat to go with the natural style love your natural textures
everyone everyone Eleanor thanks so much great to chat again oh thank you very
much Greg nice one cheers lots of the conditioners make a big deal of the
ingredients that they've got inside so to find out what they are and what
purpose they each hold I'm gonna chat again with professor of pharmaceutical
analysis within the School of Applied Sciences at Huddersfield University
professor Laura Waters hi Laura nice to see you again hi Greg how are you doing
very well last time we chatted you kindly told me about the surfactants inside
shampoo that help wash away dirt and grease on our hair I've just spoken to
Eleanor who told me that rather than doing a removal job like shampoo does
conditioners are all about depositing conditioning agents on our hair what are
they please when you wash hair it tends to deprotonate which basically means it
ends up negatively charged and that causes the tangles so one of the products in
conditioners has a positive charge which attaches to the hair so overall it
neutralizes that charge it removes the issue and so it stops it tangling up Wow
so what is it that's causing the softness then these compounds also have sort of
a another end to them and the other end of the molecule it's more like an oil
which overall act like like a smoothing oily surface with the oily end pointing
outwards that's what you can feel and that's what you see I've seen various oils
mentioned on ingredients lists any benefits from the likes of argan oil or
jojoba oil so in some of the more expensive conditioners you tend to find more
quirky oils but at the end of the day if you have any kind of oil it's going to
work just as well the oil will act to smooth the surface of the hair and it will
keep the moisture in it will stop the moisture evaporating so it will stop your
hair drying out a popular claim on these conditioners Laura is that they can
strengthen and repair your hair when I discussed that claim for shampoos I heard
that hair is essentially a long strand of dead cells filled with the protein
keratin it's dead there's no blood flow so it can't regenerate and repair is
there anything different in conditioners then to enable that you do find that
sometimes you have proteins added in there and some people believe that the
proteins if you put them onto the surface can sort of fix the keratin and make
it stronger which some people claim can repair damage I'm not so sure there's
enough evidence out there to prove that and what about the claims then that
ingredients can penetrate to the core of the hair and that that's where it does
that strengthening and that repairing is there any scientific evidence for
claims like that so hair is sort of designed to not let chemicals in in a way
it's a bit of a barrier like your skin it's not easy for things to permeate
through so the concept that something can permeate all the way through to the
middle of your hair I think is optimistic it would be very very difficult for it
to in the in the one or two minutes that people tend to leave conditioner on for
it to penetrate very far at all what about with the leave-in products though
listen to Katie wants to know if they work better than the the washout
conditioners if they're there for longer could they get deeper could they do
more I still don't think that they would have the ability to get too far in
because you're not putting that much of the product onto your hair you're only
putting a thin layer they're way more expensive per volume than the washout
conditioners most are around ten times the price are the leave-ins more
effective I wouldn't say so no so if you already have great hair which is in
good condition then whether you use a simple conditioner or leave-in conditioner
is not going to make that much difference it's for people who really need that
extra conditioning who don't mind the leave-in product weighing down the hair
those are the kinds of people that should go for the leave-in products working
down my list of conditioner ingredients and their claims what are your thoughts
on antioxidants and biotin that's b7 right okay yeah antioxidants will be in
there to help the longevity of the product the biotin is really interesting one
so in recent years there's been research that says if you increase biotin in
your diet that will help improve the growth of your nails the growth of your
hair the thickness of your hair things like that it normally takes a month or
two within their diet before you'll start to see an improvement but people do
see improvements but the question is if you're putting it on it does it do the
same thing whether you get the same benefits from putting it into a product that
you put on your hair I'm not entirely convinced myself that you would still get
that I'd love to chat about heat protection products for listener Francisca they
look to have a lot of the same ingredients as conditioners but they promise to
do something quite different what is inside these creams and these sprays to
protect our hair from heat they can be things such as polymers or silicons
anything like that really which is going to add the layer on the surface they
tend to have low thermal conductivity which basically means they're insulating
something else they tend to do is they tend to dissipate the heat more evenly
along the hair shaft Eleanor was concerned that you're unlikely to get full
coverage along that whole length of the hair so some of your hair is still going
to be exposed to high heat how much protection can these products really give
that's a really good point so you'd have to put quite a lot on to ensure every
single part of every single hair is going to be protected and you've also got to
think of it a bit like when you use sunscreen that it doesn't stop the damage
from the Sun it just increases the amount of time that you can spend in the Sun
before the damage occurs and it's the same with your hair is there any
difference in effectiveness between a cream and a spray not as far as I know and
not that has been shown scientifically I think it's personal preference really I
suppose you could argue that the sprays because the particles are smaller
they're going to more evenly coat the surface of the hair than a cream if you
have lots of crazy hair like mine you might find it quite hard with a cream to
manage to get product in all of the hair so the sprays tend to be better for
that kind of thing but with sunscreen I tend to be able to know where the cream
has gone better than I do a spray final question then Laura it comes in two
parts to this SBBS our conditioners that are promising to detangle your hair
make it shinier make it smoother are they worth it are they the best things
since sliced bread or marketing BS they're absolutely worth it some of the very
very expensive conditioners I would say are no better than the average price
conditioners so you don't need to spend a fortune but scientifically yes they do
change the surface of your hair they do help detangle your hair which is going
to make it so much easier when you're trying to brush your hair style your hair
they make it look better they make it feel better when we chatted last time you
said your choice of conditioner is much more important than your choice of
shampoo so what should someone be looking out for when choosing a conditioner
it's really hard because unless you're a chemist and know exactly what all of
the different chemicals on the back of the bottle actually mean it is really
hard and even then you don't necessarily you know know how much of each oil is
going to be in the product so it's it's a bit of a trial and error thing I'd say
it's definitely worth using conditioner and part two of the final question heat
protection sprays and creams are they SB or BS if you're going to be using heat
on your hair for styling then you really do need to do something to try and
minimize the damage so anything you can do to try and prevent that damage I'd
say is worth investing in and even if you use a product to protect your hair if
you use too high a temperature or if you apply that temperature for too long
it's still not going to work they all have limitations you want to use the
smallest amount of heat that you can at the lowest temperature for the shortest
amount of time to do the least damage to your hair or just don't use heat or
don't use heat Laura thanks so much thanks Greg it's been great to talk to you
bye bye and here's trichologist Eleanor Richardson's take on the SB BS question
onto the big final double question then conditioners that promise to volumize or
make your hair softer or shinier are they worth it are they the best things in
the sliced bread or are they marketing BS if your hair is longer or you put it
through quite a lot you need to be using a conditioner because just sheer wear
and tear heat chemicals color all are gonna take their toll on your wonderful
hair shafts and you want them looking great and you want them lasting you want
to decide when you cut your hair not your hair breaking off on its own I don't
use conditioner this hair's too short right you could use conditioner if you
wanting more shine with your hair if you're noticing that there's a bit too much
frizz certainly it doesn't matter necessarily about length it is gonna matter
more about does the hair needed as much well that's what I was wondering is this
fully aesthetic does my hair actually need conditioner no if you're really not
doing much to your hair so there's no heat damage going on now and then it gets
a brush through but it's having a good old clean regularly do you need
conditioner no your hair's gonna be fine and heat protection products that are
promising to prevent heat damage are they SB or BS I would say we're more on the
BS side for heat protection products just in terms of their claims they're
claiming a lot and truly there's a lot of human error that can creep into that
that can make it pretty useless or certainly not eliminate the the damage
completely right let's call up listeners Katie and Francisca hello both Katie
you're in Kenya Francisco you're in Switzerland that's right what an
international call hey amazing great to have you both here right let me try to
summarize what I've been discovering over the last week so Katie you asked what
is the point of conditioner what does it actually do to your hair right yes it's
all about depositing what are called conditioning agents onto your hair and they
do a few different things so I'm not sure if either of you feel that your hair
gets frizzy or tangled yeah definitely yes me too so some of that can be caused
by damaged hair but some of it can be caused by essentially static negative
charge like when you rub a balloon against your hair have you done that yeah of
course not regularly it's not part of my daily habit so conditioners contain
molecules that get attracted to the negative charge they essentially cancel it
out and that can reduce your tangles in your frizz the other end of those
molecules are oily and they point out they kind of stick out from your hair and
they make it silky smooth to touch ah lots of the claims of the conditioners is
that they'll make it shiny or that they'll offer you protection so how does that
work so those oils they can help smooth down the outer cuticle tiles essentially
that protect your hair and that can have a couple of benefits so one flattening
those cuticles means that there's less chance of moisture getting into or out of
your hair and that can protect your hair okay and the flatter those cuticles are
the more light can bounce off them so the conditions can make your hair shinier
which is of course what we see yeah okay but one place where the evidence
doesn't appear to be very strong is with their claims of strengthening or
repairing they might fill the cracks on the surface of the cuticles but the
experts that I spoke to doubt that they're gonna permeate very deeply down into
the hair shaft I think a great analogy is thinking of it like a sculpture and
you could put polyfiller on the outside which would kind of smooth it down and
make it kind of look better and you could potentially kind of go in and build a
bit of scaffolding around it or kind of make the structure a bit stronger inside
but you're not gonna do anything to the concrete itself but does that do you
have to keep the product in your hair so this is the one you want to know about
whether leave-in products work better than the ones you just rinse off in the
shower exactly not necessarily leaving them on there rather than washing them
off that could leave a kind of a protective film and that could continue to stop
that moisture effect so that could protect your hair from daily wear and tear
okay the advice was to not just use leave-in or wash out but if your hair needs
it use both okay thank you you also asked about volumizing yes I kind of feel
the jury's out on that one because if you have light hair then actually
depositing conditioning agents onto it could weigh your hair down yeah yeah I
can really see how that would happen when I asked the experts whether it was SB
or BS they were both like SB because it does do these things you know it can
help detangle and defrizz it can smooth it can protect it can make it shinier
you know it could potentially strengthen it it's not gonna repair in the way
that we want it to repair because hair is dead but I was like do I need to use
it and they said well you don't need to it's essentially aesthetics okay so if
you don't have hair that's prone to moisture loss or gain if it's not regularly
damaged then for just wear and tear you don't need to have conditioner or you
could just use it on the tips where there is that wear and tear essentially so
what do you think Katie does conditioner get the thumbs up or are you gonna
ditch it no definite thumbs up after all of that that's a great one to take away
and invest in some more conditioner and it is a step I've skipped so perhaps I
need to show my hair a bit more love with a bit more conditioner time in the
shower Francisca you've been sat there listening to this do you use conditioner
will you continue to use it of course you asked about heat protection products
the number one threat to our hair I was told do you put a lot of heat on your
hair yeah I blow-dry and I straighten my hair so a lot of heat there so can it
offer protection against heat the answer is yes the silicons and the polymers
inside can help insulate the hair from the heat but there are two things that
you need to consider here firstly you're not going to be able to cover every
hair fully in product so you can't protect your hair 100% probably not and then
secondly with the bits that are covered in product it doesn't prevent a hundred
percent of that heat getting to the hair oh I see if there is heat involved it's
definitely recommended to use a heat protection product the preference would be
to not use heat on your hair it sounds like well it's not an option is that what
I was wondering whether there's a difference depending on what sort of product
you use like a cream or or a spray one of the experts said well let's spray
particles are smaller so they could coat the surface of the hair more evenly
than a cream so that's really it on the heat protection products it's awesome
I'll continue using them and I'm so glad that I can protect my hair at least
somewhat somewhat I think the somewhat is the key there isn't it I mean you've
just got to go into it kind of eyes wide open try to use less heat if you can be
wary of it use these products but don't expect them to give you full coverage
protection but if not using heat is not an option then that might also be where
the conditioner comes in to make sure you're kind of protecting it and looking
after it you know after you've been damaging it with the heat exactly yeah thank
you both thanks for getting in touch really appreciate it yeah thank you
pleasure thanks both bye that is it from me this week next week I'm gonna have a
lie down to investigate mattresses memory foam coil sprung gel what's the
difference and with them costing anything from 200 to 2,000 pounds does spending
more get you a better night's sleep I'll be finding out see ya sliced bread was
presented by Greg foot the producer was Kate Holdsworth the world is the world
at one is next on radio for Sarah Montague standing by for that but first let's
join Elizabeth Rizzini at the BBC Weather Center for the latest this lunchtime
hi Elizabeth hello thank you Ron well for most of us today it's much more
settled day of weather following yesterday's rain but the exception to that is
across northwest Scotland where we've got outbreaks of rain just moving
southwards for the through the rest of the afternoon southwards and eastwards
really it's clouding over in eastern Scotland and in Northern Ireland but still
some brighter spells hanging on with a brisk northwesterly wind here gales
developing later on through the day across the Northern Isles and Shetland
towards southern England the West Country central southern England and southeast
England then it's cloudy some outbreaks of drizzle earlier on but that cloud
retreats southwards for the rest of the afternoon so we will start to see
something a bit brighter develop here some brighter spells even a bit of
sunshine emerging for many but that leaves us of course with a lovely slice of
sunshine for much of the rest of us the central swathe of the UK particularly
northwest England the Midlands and Wales where it's likely to continue and it
will also turn brighter for parts of East Anglia to temperatures generally round
about the seasonal average between 7 and 9 degrees Celsius double figures
locally across Scotland and Northern England but we do have a bit of windchill
to factor in as well overnight tonight everything including the cloud the
outbreaks of petering rain just pushes its way southwards the skies will stay
clearest for longest across southern counties of England and it's here where we
may will see a touch of frost into tomorrow morning elsewhere from the Midlands
northwards then we are expecting it to be frost free tomorrow our cold front
sinks southwards introduces more cloud into southern England and Wales sunny
spells developing for most of Northern England and Scotland also Northern
Ireland we could just see one or two showers here maybe but plenty of dry
weather always a chance to that some of those showers could turn a bit wintry
especially over the hills of Scotland tomorrow but there will tend to be fairly
light in nature it's quite windy towards eastern coastal areas tomorrow with
gusts of wind of around 30 to 40 miles per hour a little bit less windy further
west temperatures generally a little higher between 8 and 11 degrees Celsius but
of course you'll have to factor in a bit of added windchill it's largely dry
over the weekend Elizabeth thanks very much Elizabeth Rizzini at the BBC Weather
Centre as we approach the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine Jim
Naughty has been asking what the future might hold the world looks to the
battlefields of Ukraine and asks how and when will it end both sides speak of
