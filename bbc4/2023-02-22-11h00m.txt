 starts tomorrow evening at 6.30 on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Beep. Beep. Beep.
Beep. Beep. Beep. BBC News at ten o'clock. The Royal College of Nursing is due
to meet the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to talk about pay. The RCN has
paused its strike action in England for the discussions. Figures out yesterday
show the government received £5 billion more in tax than it spent in January.
Our political editor Chris Mason says the mood in government has now changed.
That context yesterday of this surprise surplus in the finances along came not
many hours later, this more conciliatory tone. A joint statement even from the
Royal College of Nursing and the Department of Health, which seemed some way off
up until now. But a different outlook from the National Education Union. The
strikes in schools in plenty of parts of England and across Wales next week are
going to go ahead because the National Education Union not convinced that what
the government is saying is substantially different from what they've been
saying so far. Shamima Begum is due to find out this morning whether she's
allowed back to the UK. She and two other schoolgirls from East London travelled
to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State in 2015. The Special Immigration
Appeals Commission will give a written judgment on whether she should get back
her British citizenship. Lloyds Banking Group says its profits nearly doubled in
the final three months of last year. The lender made £1.8 billion before tax, up
from £968 million in 2021. Part of the reason for the increase was the rise in
interest rates. Sir Tony Blair and Lord Hague are calling for everyone in the UK
to be given a digital ID. The former Prime Minister and ex-Conservative leader
want a pass incorporating a person's passport, driving licence, tax records,
qualifications and right to work. They say technology needs to be at the heart
of public services. The BBC has announced the hosts for the Eurovision Song
Contest in May. The semi-finals will be fronted by Alicia Dixon, the Ted Lasso
actor Hannah Waddingham and the Ukrainian singer Yulia Sannina. Graham Norton
will join them for the final. BBC News. This is BBC Radio 4. We've heard about
Shamima Begum in the news just now and we continue her story in an hour. Someone
close to Shamima Begum is looking for a way out of the so-called caliphate.
That's in our episode of The Shamima Begum Story at 11 o'clock. Now, time for
Woman's Hour with Nuala McGovern. Hello, you are very welcome to Woman's Hour.
Well, as you've been hearing there, of course, we are awaiting a decision on
Shamima Begum's future. The judges set to rule whether the removal of her UK
citizenship was lawful. Now, this is a case that has been the centre of so much
discussion about terrorism, trafficking, repatriation. We're going to speak to
our correspondent who is covering the case probably in about 20 minutes or so.
Shamima Begum, you may know, is currently in a camp in northern Syria. We are
also going to talk about another consequence of the Islamic State group, who at
their height, they held about a third of Syria, also 40% of Iraq. But the
consequence we want to talk about is the Yazidi women. They were targeted,
kidnapped and raped by IS and many now still displaced in camps in Iraqi
Kurdistan. Those camps may now close. So our guests are asking, have these women
been forgotten? We also have with us the Irish musician, Elna McEvoy. She will
be in studio today performing live. My heart is low. My heart is so low. It's
only a woman's heart can be. So a little there of her most famous song, A
Woman's Heart. Well, we have lots to talk about music, yes, but also why did
Eleanor buy herself a purple AGA cooker after a bad breakup? I want to know
about your purchases, big or small. What did you buy yourself after a breakup?
Particularly maybe if it was bad. Flowers? Maybe a dog? Radical new haircut?

reading all about them. Now, I want to turn to new research, however, before
that from Cancer Research UK and NHS Digital, which has revealed that black
women from Caribbean and African backgrounds are more likely to be diagnosed
with cancer at later stages when treatment is less likely to be successful. This
study is the first to show that ethnicity is a significant factor in late stage
diagnosis. And to discuss the reasons for this inequality, I'm joined by Kruti
Shrothri, who is head of policy development at Cancer Research UK, and also
Adobea Obeng, who sought medical help three times over two years before she was
diagnosed with incurable breast cancer at 31. You're both so welcome to the
programme. Thank you for joining us. Kruti, let me start with you and this
research. What were the differences in late stage diagnosis between black and
white women? So thank you so much for having me on this programme, Nuala. This
report by Cancer Research UK looked at several different cancer types. It looked
at breast, ovarian, uterine, non small cell lung cancer, colon and prostate
cancer. And for all of those cancer types, except prostate, because that's not
relevant for women, it found that black women are more likely to be diagnosed at
a late stage cancer. We know that early diagnosis gives the best chances of
survival. So these differences are deeply concerning and we need to address
them. Also, can we talk about the differences found for women from Indian,
Bangladeshi or Pakistani backgrounds? Yes. So the report also found that for
some cancer types, there was a difference in the stage of diagnosis for Asian
women, those particularly being breast and ovarian. So not quite so extensive as
for black women, but they did exist. Interestingly, the study found that there
were no differences between Chinese women and white women. That is interesting.
But with the findings that you have, what are some of the reasons why women in
certain ethnic groups are being diagnosed at this later stage? We don't know
exactly what the reasons are, but previous research does give us some clues. We
know from previous studies that ethnic minority groups have lower awareness of
the signs and symptoms of cancer. And even if they do spot something, there are
more barriers that prevent them from going to their GP to get checked out. So,
for example, we know that they are more likely to be embarrassed about talking
about these issues to their GP. And interestingly, black and Asian communities
are also more likely to have fatalistic attitudes towards cancer. So an attitude
which is, well, there's no point doing anything about it because it's not in my
control. So I'm not going to go and see my GP. But something I think that's
really important is that while these behavioral factors are really important
component, it's not just down to individual behavior. There also seems to be
differences in access to care. So ethnic minority groups are more likely to
report having to go multiple times to their GP compared to white groups to get
referred for further tests. So clearly there is a systematic problem here that
we need to address. Well, I want to bring in Adobea. Welcome, Adobea. For our
listeners, you are black. What was your experience of finding out you had
cancer? Hi, good morning. Thank you for having me. My experience was, it was a
devastating experience, obviously. First of all, finding out that I had breast
cancer and then obviously finding out that it was a secondary diagnosis. And
unfortunately, like I say, my case incurable. Take us back to this journey that
you've gone through from your first inclination to visit a doctor. What was
that? So I found a lump in my breast in 2016, so I would have been 29 at the
time. And sort of my first thought wasn't, you know, let me go and get this
checked out. It kind of was a small lump in my breast and I kind of was getting
on with my day and my life. But I noticed that the breast lump was getting
bigger and I thought, OK, I need to get it checked out. When I first initially
went to my GP, had an exam and I was told that it was just ordinary breast lumps
and it was nothing to be worried about. And because of my age, my GP wasn't
concerned and I was sent on my way and I just continued on with life. I'm just
wondering, after that, was it were you still worried or was there an acceptance?
OK, that's what the doctor says. After I'd seen the GP, had my exam and I was
told by the GP there was nothing to worry about, I was like, OK, there's nothing
to worry about. Let me continue with my life. And I did say, you know, until
2017 when the lump had grown, you know, even larger. And I was starting to
notice it and I started to notice all the discoloration and the dimpling, which,
you know, at the time, like I say, I didn't I wasn't aware of it. But at the
time I was presenting all the symptoms of breast cancer and then had to go to
the GP again. And then I was told again that it wasn't anything to be worried
about and it's just a breast lump. And if it becomes painful, then I should come
back. My goodness, my goodness. It continued. Tell our listeners what happened
next. So in April of 2018, I was going to work an ordinary Monday and I had an
excruciating pain in my chest, a pain I've never experienced before. And I was
finding it very difficult to breathe. Luckily, I was with a work colleague and
we went to my local accident and emergency. And when I arrived there, I was told
by the doctors on duty there that I had musculoskeletal pain and was given some
painkillers and sent home. That following week, the pain was getting even more
excruciating. I was finding it difficult to move around, to breathe. And I
insisted again when I went into A&E again that I need a scan, some sort of scan,
because something is not right. And, you know, I need to find out what's
happening. I did have a CT scan done and I was told in May of 2018 that I had
breast cancer. And unfortunately, it had spread to my lymph nodes and they were
querying areas in my lung and my my bone at the time. So, yeah, that was that
was pretty much my journey. And it was an uphill battle because I had to insist
that I needed some sort of scan because something wasn't right. Adobea, I mean,
it must have been incredibly traumatic. But to bring you back at that point when
you were told that, what went through your mind? I mean, up until the time I had
all the sort of the tests, I had to have a biopsy and a mammogram and all the
tests that you need for them to find out exactly what's happening. I was
actually in denial for a very long time. It was only once the oncologist said
the words, you have breast cancer, that I actually, you know, had to take a step
back and realise, wow, this is serious. And I have this serious disease. But up
until that point, cancer, I wasn't thinking that I had breast cancer. I was
going through the words of the GP telling me that I'm too young and it's nothing
to worry about. It's breast lump. So, yeah, it was a it was a very difficult and
traumatic experience for me. And I want to hear more about your life. And thank
you for sharing that, Adobea. I'm sure it's very difficult. But Kruti, what
about that experience that poor Adobea went through? It's really difficult to
hear, isn't it? And, you know, the sad truth is that this isn't one instance.
What research suggests is that this is happening systematically and it needs to
be addressed. What I would like to see is the government do more to make
tackling these inequalities a priority for the health community. And some of
that is going to have to include making sure that we have more data, better data
sets so that we can understand what's going on and we can address that, we can
actually understand what the barriers are and we can address the problems. It's
also going to need to be resourcing the health service properly, because if the
health service haven't got the headspace to address these really important
issues, which they haven't at the moment, they are on the brink, then it's not
going to be going to be possible to move forward. I'm going to read a little of
the Department of Health and Social Care statement that we just received. More
patients are being diagnosed, they say, and starting treatment earlier with 92
community diagnostic centres open since 2021, delivering over 3 million tests,
scans and checks, including to detect cancer. We also recently announced a £10
million investment in more breast cancer screening units, as well as software
and service upgrades. The NHS Help Us Help You awareness campaign includes
advertising targeted to reach black, Asian and minority ethnic groups to address
challenges to earlier diagnosis, such as fear of what might be found. They go on
to say addressing cancer together with other conditions in a joined up strategy
will allow us to focus where there are similarities in approach and ensure care
is focused on the patient. But that wasn't you, Adobea, it wasn't about a fear
of what might be found. No, it wasn't. It was, I mean, in my opinion, sort of
being misdiagnosed. Like I said, I was presenting all the symptoms of breast
cancer. I had obviously the lump, I had the dimpling, I had the discolouration.
The only thing that wasn't happening that I didn't have was the leaking from the
nipple. But I was presenting all symptoms of breast cancer and unfortunately
that wasn't picked up on. Why do you think it wasn't? I mean, I have different
theories, but I feel perhaps maybe the GP just didn't know what breast cancer
looked like on a dark skinned person. So perhaps, you know, they weren't able to
just pick up on those symptoms on my body, unfortunately. Maybe they didn't have
access to the medical journals that shows how breast cancer presents on darker
skin. But I feel that had he known what to look for, what it would look like on
my skin, maybe he may have been able to pick up on it sooner when I first went
in. I'm so sorry to hear that. A question did come in from a listener to you,
Clotilde. Does black women in your research include women of mixed race? It
doesn't. Black women, we are specifically referring to Caribbean and African
women. I understand. Adobe, let me go back to you. You're alive now. That was
twenty one, twenty nine, excuse me, when you first found the lump. Thirty one, I
believe, by the time you were diagnosed. Tell me about now. Well, now I'm on a
hormone targeted treatment, which is working fantastically. I will be coming up
to my sort of five years of being on treatment and having my condition stable in
May of this year. But it has been you know, it's been like I say, it's been an
uphill battle. I've had, you know, my down times. I've had great news. I've had
bad news. I've had, you know, emotional times as well. But I maintain on trying
to stay positive and just kind of having faith in the treatment that I'm on,
which is working wonderfully for me at the moment. Now, we wish you the best of
luck with that. Kruti, you know, Adobe, they mentioned black skin, for example,
or not being able to perhaps be familiar with the skin or some of the symptoms.
What else needs to be done to try and change these numbers that you've seen?
Yeah, there are a few things. So I think that it's really important that we do
more campaigns to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms. of cancer targeted
at those communities where awareness is lower. There's been a great example
where black men are at higher risk of prostate cancer. And there have been a lot
of campaigns over the recent years to raise awareness of this amongst both black
men and GPs. And we're seeing much better diagnosis rates, early diagnosis rates
amongst them. Cancer Research UK run talk cancer workshops with community
leaders to help them have conversations about cancer with their community. And
these are aimed at breaking down barriers to get people to see their GP if they
have a concern. And it also emphasises the importance of early diagnosis. But as
I said before, I do think that ultimately the government need to do more at
making addressing these inequalities a priority for the health community. The
government recently dropped their health disparities white paper and they
committed last year to a war on cancer and a 10 year cancer plan, which they
have also dropped. Yes, we have a major condition strategy that they've now
committed to, but this is a catch all strategy spanning several conditions,
health inequalities, prevention. And we need to make sure that government action
is properly targeted so that we can move forward. It does seem like a different
strategy. They talk about a joined up strategy. They talk about treating the
whole body just to let our listeners know that instead of the plan, the 10 year
plan of the war on cancer. As you discussed there, just before I let you go,
Adobea, have you gone back to those doctors that didn't diagnose you? Have you
had that confrontation? No, I haven't. I feel like I'm still harbouring some
kind of resentment. And a little bit of disappointment and anger in that
situation. I actually moved GPs as well. I completely moved a GP surgery. I
think, like I said, trying to maintain a positive mindset and kind of moving on
and moving forward with my life. It's not something that I'm thinking about
going to approach or speak to them about. I kind of have made my decision to
leave the GP practice that I was at that misdiagnosed me. And now I found my
voice. And if anything presents or I find that my treatment isn't how I expect
it to be, I will speak up about it now. And I think that's a good lesson I
learned from my experience. And I know you share it as a fashion blogger as
well. That is Adobea Obeng. An awful lot of listeners getting in touch, I should
tell you, Adobea as well, sympathising with you and your story. Also want to
thank Crue T. Schroetrie. Thanks so much for getting in touch and sharing the
news research that has just come out. We're going to be going to Eleanor McEvoy
in just a moment, but I do want to read a message coming in. This is I'm
listening to the lady speaking on Woman's Hour. I'm so sad. I'm currently
waiting to start treatment for breast cancer. I was seen very quickly, listened
to, not once dismissed. I'm a white woman under 50. I find it awful. In 2023, we
still have these discrepancies in health care based on race. It is not
acceptable. Thanks for your comments coming in. We're going to be talking about
what you bought yourself during a bad breakup in just a moment. A lot of people
responding to that one as well. 84844. But I mentioned Eleanor McEvoy. She is
one of Ireland's foremost songwriters. She's worked with the likes of U2, Sinead
O'Connor and Mary Black. She's the composer and co-performer of A Woman's Heart.
That was the title track of the bestselling Irish album in Irish history. One of
Ireland's favourite folk songs. It also featured in Derry Girls, if you're a fan
of that. Eleanor, she's currently on a UK tour. Her latest album is Gimme Some
Wine. It has themes ranging from breakups to motherhood, also female friendship.
She's with me in the studio. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Very well.
Good to have you with us. So Gimme Some Wine, the album. What inspired it? Well,
it was recorded and conceived of really during lockdown, which is part of the
reason why it's called Gimme Some Wine. The other reason why it's called Gimme
Some Wine is, of course, the magnificent painting on the cover by Chris Golan,
wonderful British artist called Chris Golan that I've been collaborating with.
And he was painting paintings about my songs. I was then writing songs about his
paintings. And we were going back and forth. Sadly, he passed away in 2017. But
that was how that came to be on the cover. So, yeah, during lockdown, like a lot
of people, I think I reflected on my life and where I was and, you know, what my
role was in the music business now as a 56 year old woman, you know, how do I
fit into it? You know, we could see what the doctors and nurses were doing. What
was I doing? And without wanting to get too new agey about it, I'm a huge
believer in the healing power of music. And, you know, I think that, you know,
my mission when I get up on stage is to, you know, to make people who are down
or tired after work, to transform them, to bring joy into their lives. And
that's not to say that you don't hit the darker spots, you address the more
serious issues, be they anorexia or breakups or whatever. But if I'm not sending
them home at the end of the night with joy in their hearts, I feel I have
failed. There's so much darkness out there, there's so much dark literature,
dark theatre, dark, you know, so that's kind of my aim. Well, our listeners are
going to get a little bit of a live performance in just a few minutes time. But
let's learn a little bit more about you. You studied music at Trinity College in
Dublin, played in orchestras. I was also reading. But when did the songwriting
come into play? To be honest, Nuala, I was always songwriting. It's just I never
really sang them for anybody. So I mean, I had a hundred of the songs written,
you know, literally before I'd ever played one to any. I don't know what I think
I thought I was, you know, Emily Dickinson or something, and I was going to die
at 35 and they'd find all these thousands of songs in my bedroom. I don't know
what I was thinking. But it was odd because once I'd written the song, I didn't
feel the need to play it. For me, the joy was in the writing or the buzz or the
compulsion was in the writing part. Still is, to be honest. But then when I was
in the symphony orchestra, I played a track to my brother and he said, Eleanor,
you've got to be doing this, you know, get me. I borrowed his band and did a
demo and then just started to look for. I actually had a turning point moment. I
walked into the symphony orchestra one day and I mean, you're on a salary when
you're in an orchestra and all that. But I had been I was down the back of the
second violins, you know, and this gentleman had been moved down behind me. And
he used to lead the orchestra, a very, you know, eminent violinist. And I
thought, oh, my God, as you get older, you get moved back in this job. You know,
most jobs as you get older and get more mature and get more experience, they
move you up the chain. But of course, your fingers go, you know, and I thought,
oh, Eleanor, give the songwriting thing a shot. Just try it. So that day I went
to the manager of the orchestra and said, look, I'm Paddy. I won't be, you know,
I'm going to be leaving my notice and, you know, don't be calling me again after
X amount of weeks. And I went. What does Paddy say now? I don't know. I haven't
seen him for years, actually. I bet he's heard you. But some of the tracks going
back to the album are very personal to you. Yeah. You know, I had a time, I
mean, obviously, Covid was a tough time for our industry. But to be honest, it
was nothing compared to what had happened to me prior to that. I'd had a lot of
stuff happen to me at the same time, Nuala. You know, my dad died in a couple of
weeks later. My relationship of 23 years literally just like that overnight
went. And it was an awful shock. And, you know, it was it was very horrible and
complicated. And it turned out he'd had somebody else in another country the
whole time he'd been with me. My goodness. Yeah. So, I mean, it was you find out
23 years of your life has been a sham. And it puts you, well, certainly it put
me into a very dark psychological place. I mean, I experienced darkness I don't
think I've ever experienced in my life. So I had to think, OK, how do you how do
you how do you get yourself out of this? Or, you know, so for me, I said, OK,
just start again. Start a new life. And for me, that sort of worked. And by the
way, don't worry, there's only two tracks about it on the album in case anybody
thinks I'm here. But it is an awful lot to take on. And was this kind of towards
the end of lockdown or? No, it was just before. So it was a year before
lockdown. OK, so I had a year of kind of trying to get over that and then
lockdown hit. And, you know, I feel very guilty saying this, but in a way,
lockdown provided me with a bit of time to heal because I was pretending to the
world I was fine. Because, you know, in my business, you've got to get up on
stage. The show must go on. You know, if you want to make a living, you've got
to keep doing it. And I just had to kind of withdraw a bit from social media and
all that just to kind of, you know, start again, essentially, and kind of
reinvent myself. And I decided, God, Eleanor, this time, like what decisions
have you made in your life, girl, that have led to this? You know, and I. But
that sounds like you're blaming yourself. Well, you know, I've since had, again,
I'm sounding very new age here, but I did go for. I actually did go for therapy
and I have to say it was absolutely transformative. And I wish I'd gone 20 years
ago because I put up with stuff I should never have put up with. It wasn't
really a big thing in Dublin, though, in the 70s and 80s. It wasn't. You know
what it was like. I mean, you know what it was like back then. God, I was just
saying to you, you know, when I was in college, like I was telling my daughter
now, you know, contraceptive was illegal when I was in college. Like, I wasn't
just frowned upon or hard-kicked. It was against the law. The Students' Union
sold condoms one time. They got arrested, you know. So times have changed. Yeah.
We were looking at you guys over here. You had like the, you know, in the NHS,
you had it for free. And it was definitely, and Ireland has changed a lot. But
that is so interesting that you've kind of started again, I suppose, after
lockdown. And what is it like then touring because you're in the middle of it at
the moment? It's great. I'm loving it, you know. But, you know, it made me look
at like things like the song I'm going to do for you, Southampton Street, you
know, it's a little tiny street off. Larkham Street. One day I was there, and
this is ages ago, but I met my ex, you know, from 30 years ago from college. I'm
showing my age there. But anyway, and when I thought about that, I thought
during lockdown, I was thinking, God, the road's not taken. What if I had gone
that road instead of that road, you know. So it was all of this kind of
reflection. And yeah. Maybe that's something that comes. I know you went through
that terrible breakup, but the, an age that you reach as well. You mentioned
you're 56, that maybe there will always be that reflection of the road not
taken. I think there will. And I think it's easy to say, oh, well, I wouldn't
have ended up, you know, you don't know. You just don't know in life. Things
could have been worse. You know, you, you know, you have to take, you know, the
sliding door moments and just, you know, get up and get on with it, you know.
Well, you know, we talk about the breakup there. I believe there's a connection
to a purple agate that you have. The cooker stove range. Yeah. Well, after the
breakup, I don't know, I got a, I bought a purple agate in a moment of, I don't
know, midlife crisis or something. But it is the best thing that caused me far
less grief than the man ever did. And I didn't run off with other agates or
anything like that. So, yeah, I just love it. It's just, and people said, get a
neutral coloured one in case you want to sell that. I said, no, I'm getting a
purple one. I love my purple one. So, yeah. A lot of people, because I threw it
out to our audience, and there's nothing that they are, if not responsive. Let
me see. After a breakup, I bought myself a plane ticket to East Africa and had
an adventure. Absolute winner. When I left my husband 35 years ago, I bought a
pink fluffy dressing gown. He hated pink and a piece of breaded chicken. He was
a vegetarian. All my dressing gowns are still pink. Not that my husband would
notice. Oh, so she has a new one now who loves her and is happy with whatever
she wears or eats. I dyed my hair red, says another, when my ex told me he was
leaving. He hated red hair. Oh, he's in my bad books too then. I bought myself a
lovely convertible BMW when the divorce was finalised. That's Terry. Let me see.
Amanda, a new lipstick. Essential. I also took the opportunity to try something
I've thought off for a long time, but never done. A new hair colour. Nothing too
dramatic. Oh, here we go again. But a bit of red goes a long way. Is red the
colour post-breakup? I don't know. There's another call-in segment. Let me see,
another post-breakup gift. I recently split from my husband. I bought myself a
concert ticket and a hotel room to meet friends from an online fan club of the
same band. Not something I could have done before and I'm so excited. Isn't that
wonderful? And isn't that a lovely segue to get you to perform? South Ann Street
for us now. Yes, South Ann Street. There's a little street you will know. It's
off Grafton Street if you've ever been to Dublin. There's a couple of bars
there. You never know who you might run into, as Eleanor was telling us, she ran
into the ex from 30 years previous, was it, Eleanor? As she pops on her
headphones there. Yeah. Can I launch him? You sure can. Go for it. He said he'd
seen my posters on a billboard near his street. And he'd heard about what
happened. And we both just looked away. And headed from South Ann Street to
McDade's. Where we drank to ancient love for hours on end. And raised our
glasses to remember absent friends. And we drank to chance encounters too long
overdue. On South Ann Street on a Tuesday afternoon. And it felt just like it
used to. Like we'd never been apart. Like back when we were students on a bench
in College Park. But I felt something deep inside of me. I really can't explain.
In a pub beside South Ann Street in the rain. When we drank to ancient love for
hours on end. And raised our glasses to remember absent friends. And we drank to
chance encounters too long overdue. On South Ann Street on a Tuesday afternoon.
We embraced before we parted. To walk into the night. With the complicated
sadness. At this complicated life. Oh where ships passing in the night.
Occasionally meet. At the corner of South Ann and Grafton Street. Where we drank
to ancient love for hours on end. And raised our glasses to remember absent
friends. And we drank to chance encounters too long overdue. On South Ann Street
on a Tuesday afternoon. Yes we drank to ancient love for hours on end. We raised
our glasses to remember absent friends. Oh and sometimes if I'm lonely. And I'm
walking on my own. I'll detour down South Ann Street going home. Well done,
Eleanor. Lovely to hear your song performing right there, South Ann Street. Do
you want one more story that came in from our listener about what they did for
their breakup gift? I bought myself three rats. My partner and I always hated
them. So I thought I could get over my fear of them and I could get over our
relationship. Turns out they were much better company than he ever was. And they
smelt less too, says Kathy in Cardiff. Thanks so much for coming in to us,
Eleanor. Give Me Some Wine is her album and she is touring right now in the UK
until the 11th of March. Now I want to turn next to actually a story just coming
in to us. I mentioned Shamima Begum at the beginning of the programme. We are
just getting the news that she has lost her appeal at the special, the SIAC,
which is the Special Immigration Court. It has been dismissed on all grounds,
the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, I should say. So she has lost that.
She was hoping to appeal the decision to revoke her citizenship and that in turn
may lead to her being repatriated. But that is not going to happen as she has
just lost that coming in over the past few minutes. But I want to continue
talking about the Islamic State group, which of course was a big part of the
Shamima Begum story because it's almost nine years since they announced they
were establishing a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. That was back in June 2014,
would you believe. Many of their actions made headline news, like the public
executions and also radicalisation. But one element that perhaps we don't talk
about as much is what the UN have described as the genocide committed by IS
against the Yazidi people. It was the Yazidi women who faced some of the most
horrific treatment. IS captured thousands of Yazidi women and also girls and
kidnapped and raped them. Eight years later, Yazidi women and girls live in
camps of internally displaced people, dealing with the trauma they experienced
on a daily basis. There are still around 3,000 of these women and girls
unaccounted for. And now the Iraqi government have made it clear that they want
to close these camps. My next two guests have just recently returned from
visiting some of the camps which are in northern Iraq. Rachel Wright is a
freelance journalist. Rachel Minor is the founder and CEO of the UK charity
Bellwether International, whose mission is to protect the freedom of religion or
belief in areas across the world. I asked Rachel Wright to start by explaining
who the Yazidi people are. Well, the Yazidis are a sort of ethno-religious group
that have lived in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq and Syria for many years,
about 4,000 years. We went to their most sacred temple and we found urns that
were used to make olive oil that were 4,000 years old. But they've mostly lived
in Sinjar, which is a mountainous region on the border between Iraq and Syria.
And, you know, they've always been subject to oppression and genocides,
attempted genocides, throughout their history because the Kurds want them to be
Kurdish and the Arabs don't like them. And a lot of people call them infidels,
especially Muslims, because they're not Muslim, they have their own religion.
And their own religion is Zoroastrian. Yeah, it's sort of a mixture of a lot of
different practices. So it's very specific and unique. There is no other
religion like it. So there were always issues with the Yazidis. And after the
Iraq War in 2003, the area was subject to disputes between the new Kurdish
government in northern Iraq and the Iraqi government. So there were already
issues. Then in 2014, ISIS came in and there was a genocide. They shot, I think,
thousands of men on the spot. They executed them and they kidnapped the women
and girls and some boys and took them away and turned them into sexual slaves.
The people that escaped, escaped up onto Sinjar Mountain and various communities
helped them to survive. And then they managed to escape and they went out into
northern Iraq and they are now, most of them, there's nearly 200,000 displaced
Yazidis living in their own country but living in what's called internally
displaced people's camps. And just with the term genocide, there's not a global
recognition of the treatment by the Yazidis, by ISIS as a genocide. The UN have
described it as genocide. So it just differs depending on where you are in the
world. So that brings us up to what they have gone through when it comes to
ISIS. You have gone to northern Iraq, however, to visit camps where Yazidi
families are, particularly women and children. What did you see? I saw massive
tent cities. I saw running open sewers. I saw people living with nothing to do.
Very moving, actually. I mean, I've been to a lot of places in the world and I
found this very, very moving, partly because it's been eight years since what
happened happened. And these people have gone nowhere. They have nothing to do.
Nobody sort of is on their side. Now they can't go back to Xinjiang because
there's a whole host of other people that are fighting over it. So they are
displaced within their own country. We saw one particular camp where there was a
little boy eating from the rubbish. We met this young girl who was 11 who had
been kidnapped by ISIS when she was six and used as a sex slave for goodness
knows how many years. And then she's now celebrating her rescue. But the trauma
that that little girl has gone through. So I found it deeply moving. Yes, and
with the term, I know it has been sometimes used, sex slave, with Yazidi women
and girls, but some people prefer that it's kidnapped and raped is what happened
to a lot of these girls and women. Rachel Minor, I'd like to bring you in here.
You founded the charity Bellwether International after learning about the Yazidi
people. What was it in particular about their story that was the catalyst for
you to take action? The Yazidis are just like us. They're just like a lot of
groups in the world who are practising either a faith or a belief, living in a
community, trying to have a thriving economy. I was astonished that the Yazidi
genocide was somewhat of a silent genocide. I had no idea that it had happened
and I'd lived through it. And many of the women affected were my same age at the
time. And I was disturbed. I was appalled that a genocide in the 21st century
could unfold in the age of social media and technology. And yet a lot of these
stories go untold and a lot of the crisis goes unresponded to. As Rachel
mentioned, it's been eight years and counting, and there's still 2,874 missing
women and girls. That's appalling. That's striking. It's disturbing. I lose
sleep thinking about these women who are just like us, but in another part of
the world who are destined to a different fate. And as I mentioned, of course,
what has happened to them, whether it's the term genocide that is used or not,
perhaps what has happened to them is seen differently in different parts of the
world as you talk about it. But you have been working particularly with
psychological help for some of the Yazidi women that you have met. Talk us
through that a little bit and I suppose how successful that has been. Mel
Whither's model is to work locally and through partner organisations, most of
which are actually Yazidi-run and operated. And one of the things that Mel
Whither focuses on is specific humanitarian gaps. So when we came into the
landscape and learned that the first thing that loses funding is mental health
response, trauma response, that was the gap we decided to fill. Particularly for
young girls and youth, there were little to no interventions around these lines.
So we assembled a group of Yazidi social workers to be true to our localised
model. And they actually helped us design a cognitive behavioural therapy model
which relies on narrative group therapy sessions. And it's evidence-based. It's
been validated in studies across the globe. But the amazing part about our
material was they were Yazidi-fied. We took a lot of the Western medical
language and made it local. We were mindful of religious sensitivities, cultural
sensitivities, and created a product with the Yazidi community that reflected
what they wanted. And then they were the implementing power behind the
intervention. So we trained Yazidi women to run these CBT sessions. And there's
a pre- and post-survey that helps us to measure that impact. So we had really
high scores on the trauma before these sessions. After going through one
intervention, these scores dropped by 45%. There was a 45% mental health
improvement, which means that these women are able to function in their lives
and provide for their children. Many of the Yazidis displaced our single-mother
families because the husbands are missing or have been killed. But I am thinking
about locally, because when you read about Yazidi women, those that have made it
back, for example, to their communities which are being kidnapped and at times
going through rape and other trauma, they're not always fully accepted from what
I understand, or indeed the children that they may have had with IS fighters.
There's enormous stigma surrounding sexual assault in the Yazidi community. And
after the genocide, the Yazidi spiritual council actually had to make formal
statements about allowing Yazidi women who had been assaulted back into the
community, which is horrific, should never be the case. Women who experience
this trauma also experience enormous stigma, double jeopardy, and all kinds of
intersectionality. But over time, we do see some things being destigmatized,
like some Yazidis are brought back into the community, but there's still many,
many Yazidi women that remain on the outside, especially if they have children
born of rape. This is an enormous barrier for them to reenter their community,
to reenter Iraqi society, and that's something that we hope to target through
these interventions, is not only improve mental health outcomes, but actually
give women language and skills and give the community language and skills to
break down these barriers, to come together so that they can heal as a
community. Why do you think, Rachel Wright, that these stories of these women
and girls have not been told? It's a very good point. I mean, when Rachel
approached me to come and see the Yazidis, I sort of thought, you know, I
haven't heard about them since 2014, and I really don't know. I mean, I think
people move on. The news cycle moves on. There's so many things to talk about,
and I guess, you know, Islamic State, they were so horrendous that people were
concentrating perhaps on defeating them and getting rid of them, and then once
they'd gone, maybe people thought, well, that's the end of that now. You know,
we don't have to worry about it. But the amount of people I've talked to who
have never heard of the Yazidis, and these are journalists as well, young
journalists, you know, because it, I don't know, it was eight years ago. Maybe
that's a long time in people's minds. But I have been very surprised, and that's
why I'm so shocked when I went there. You know, it's a huge community. There's
200,000 people who are displaced living in these camps. We know that the Iraqi
government say they plan to close the camps, not known when that might happen.
What do you think needs to happen in the future for these women? Rachel Minor.
There's a lot. I would say that from the outside looking in, you would say maybe
there's nothing that can be done, but I push back on that. There's actually
quite a lot that can be done, and we've seen that the international community
can rally both to create awareness campaigns, like I think of the Bring Back Our
Girls during the Chibok kidnappings in Nigeria. We could generate the same kind
of campaign for the missing Yazidi women and girls, and that's a matter of
social media political will, which we see trend and transpire very quickly. So
certainly the international community should keep talking and continue talking
about the Yazidis and these women and girls until the problem is solved. And
whether the genocide is acknowledged by every country in the world or not, it is
genocide. The UN Convention has been triggered, and we have a duty to respond as
citizens of the human family. Rachel Minor, CEO of Bellwether International, and
Rachel Wright, freelance journalist. Thanks to them. And to reiterate on the
matter of whether or not the attack on the Yazidi in 2014 is a genocide or not,
we have a statement from the government. They say the UK is a longstanding
supporter of Yazidi women and advocated strongly for the passing of the Yazidi
Survivors Law. We provide financial support to women's organizations in Iraq who
provide vocational training and workshops for Yazidi women and have committed
over £278 million in humanitarian support to Iraq since 2014. Our longstanding
policy is that any judgment as to whether genocide has occurred is a matter for
a competent national or international court rather than for governments or non-
judicial bodies. Well, staying with the Islamic State group, I was mentioning
judges from the Special Immigration Appeals Commission have decided the removal
of British citizenship from Shamima Begum, who left the UK as a 15-year-old
schoolgirl to join Islamic State, was lawful. In the hearing last year
challenging the decision, her legal team says it ignored the fact that she may
have been trafficked into Syria. Let me bring in our BBC Home Affairs
correspondent Daniel Sanford, who has been following the story this morning.
Good morning, Daniel. Good to have you with us. So was this the expected
outcome? I think it was the more likely outcome. You never know when very, very
clever judges get to sit on these very high-profile cases, but it was always the
more likely outcome. As you say, essentially Shamima Begum's lawyers had argued
that rather than voluntarily travelling across the Islamic State and being a
sort of full and wholehearted supporter of the group, she had in fact been
trafficked essentially by being groomed and persuaded to travel to Syria and
that she'd been trafficked for sexual purposes because on arrival in Syria she
was almost immediately married off to an adult Islamic State fighter. They said
that this was child trafficking for sexual purposes. And what's interesting,
although the Syyak court ruled against her legal team on all grounds, they did
say that they had some sympathy for those arguments. They said that there was a
credible suspicion that Shamima Begum had been trafficked to Syria within the
meaning of the relevant international law, and they also said that there were
arguable breaches of duty by her school, the local council and the police, in
that they should have known there was a risk that she might travel to Syria
after one of her school friends had already done so. But despite those clear
concerns that the judges had, they decided that in the end it is up to the Home
Secretary to decide whether somebody poses a threat to national security, and
the trafficking arguments didn't overwhelm that and in fact weren't entirely
relevant because Shamima Begum is still in northeast Syria, and so they
concluded that it was up to the Home Secretary to decide if she poses a threat
to national security, and as Sajid Javid, who was then Home Secretary, decided
that, then there was nothing unlawful or incorrect about his decision. I can
hear the rain and the water behind you there, Daniel, as you speak to us from
outside the court. But many people will want to know, OK, this has happened,
what would it mean for her, I suppose, path as she tries to continue to return
to the UK? Well, she does have the right to appeal, so this isn't like the
final, final hurdle. She can appeal this decision and I would imagine, given the
sensitive and high-profile nature of the case, that is pretty likely. If she
were to ultimately fail on all of her legal grounds, then she has only one other
path out of Syria, and that is if she exercises her right to her Bangladeshi
citizenship and the Bangladeshi government allow her to go there. This is, of
course, a country that she wasn't born in, a country that she's never lived in,
so she has very, very few ties to Bangladesh, other than through her parentage.
But Bangladesh, of course, have always said that they don't see that she's
anything to do with them and they wouldn't accept her. So that would then leave
her in a camp in north-east Syria, effectively in permanent exile in a tent in
the desert. And that, many people feel, is an unsustainable situation for her
and the many others who are there, because, of course, those camps, which are
effectively detention camps in north-east Syria, are permanent institutions.
They're run by a kind of makeshift government in a rebel part of Syria. It's
possible to escape from them. It's possible they could be overrun at some point
in any flare-up of the civil war in Syria. So to have these tens of thousands of
people in this situation in north-east Syria isn't particularly sustainable,
many people feel. And at some point someone's going to have to grip it. There
are countries, America, Australia, some European countries, who've started to
return people who are their citizens and maybe even people that had strong ties
to their countries. But at the moment the British government shows no sign of
doing that. Daniel Sanford, thank you so much. The BBC's Home Affairs
correspondent, persevering there, even with the rain and the noise around him,
to bring us an update on that story. I want to turn back in time, back to 1838.
A middle-class woman, Mrs Anne Sykes, she was given a diary on her wedding day.
And over the years, Anne filled it with snippets of fabric from clothes and then
annotated each one. The diary survived and nearly 200 years later, Kate
Strasden, a fashion historian, came across it and spent six years researching
the materials that were stuck inside. So turning this Victorian scrapbook into
her own book, The Dress Diary of Mrs Anne Sykes, and piecing together really the
lives that she encountered through these fabrics as well. It's a lovely book.
It's this window into a certain time through fabric, really. You're so welcome.
Thank you for joining us, Kate. Well, talk to me a little bit about how you came
across it. It's a curiously woman's kind of story, really, because I started to
make lace when I was in my 20s and belonged to a group in Devon, where I'm from,
a group of much older women than me. And after one of our meetings, one of the
ladies said, well, I have some things that I want to get rid of and I wonder if
you'd like to come and have a look. And I spent a very happy afternoon with her.
And the very last thing that she took out of a trunk, a rappai that worked for
her had come along. The story of its kind of journey was an amazing one. She had
worked in the theatre world here in London in the 1960s in the wardrobes. And a
guy that worked for her had come along and said, oh, I found this on Camden
Market on one Sunday morning, paid a few pence for it, knew nothing about it.
And he gave it to her. And it was this album that's just full of swatches, over
2000 of them, but no information about where it came from. And she passed it on
to me. And the size of the book, just for our listeners to visualise? It's just
over A4 size, covered in pink silk and absolutely bulging with fabrics. It's
just a unique object. So you have figured out it's Mrs Anne Sykes. How did you
figure that out first off? All of the swatches are written in the third person,
which made me think that actually it's just going to be a curiosity, a mystery.
We'll never know. But thankfully, just once out of all of those swatches, Anne
identified herself, she revealed herself. She wrote a swatch above one of the
swatches. She wrote the dress of Mrs Anne Sykes, May 1840. And she said, the
first dress I wore in Singapore. So it was just that one and only moment that
she acknowledged this was her book. And that was what unravelled the whole
thing. I love the word unravel for this as well. We're talking about threads and
about fabrics. Why do you think she did it? I think at the time women were,
these kind of practices were quite common in terms of gathering autographs or
poetry and scrapbooking was a popular pastime. She grew up as the daughter of a
mill owner in Lancashire. And so textiles were at the very heart of what she had
grown up with. And I think it was a way of memorialising the people that she met
across her life, friends, family. It's a real female network. And it was her way
of remembering people. Talk to our listeners about like dressing. There's a
lovely section in the book. She lived for seven years in Singapore and her
friend Fanny came to stay with her, live with her for a period of time. And like
dressing is this way in the 19th century, you often see photographs of sisters
wearing the same clothes, but just grown sisters. But occasionally you do get
these non-blood relatives who, for whatever reasons, I think as a kind of sign
of sisterhood, who are sharing garments that are the same, whether it's ribbons,
whether it's whole gowns. And I think it's a kind of a signal of attachment,
sisterhood. And it's as well as conventional balls. There were so many and it's
it features in the diary. The other part I loved was the bachelor ball, May 4th,
1848. As well as conventional balls, there were so many fancy dress balls. Why
do you think they had such a fascination at that point in time? It was a
brilliant way of being able to dress in unconventional styles. And it was
complicated. They were really good at coming up with all sorts of different
costumes. And there's a brilliant, the swatch in the book is the dress of Dolly
Varden. Dolly Varden was a character in Charles Dickens' Barnaby Rudge. And she
dresses, she's kind of on the fringes, Dolly Varden of polite society. She's a
barmaid. And so the chance for this middle class woman to dress up in slightly
risque costumes didn't come along very often. And it's a brilliant swatch. I
loved reading about them and also some of the mannerisms that they would have or
how they'd leave, I suppose, their norms at the door when they dressed up. But
also I was fascinated by the story of Mrs Margaret Charnock, her cook. Very
unusual to have fabric from that woman. Really unusual. The working class dress
doesn't really survive in museums. It wasn't often collected. It was, it just,
and it didn't make it to that kind of space. So the census name that kind of
cropped up and I seemed familiar, I knew I recognised it and went back to the
book and found this name, Margaret Charnock. And yes, she had been Adam and
Anne's cook for a long time, but you just don't see these kind of scraps. And
there it is, this lovely, colourful piece of cotton. It's just a window, I
suppose, and you begin to get an idea of her life and you piece it together and
there's some stuff you know and of course some stuff that we don't know or maybe
we'll never know. But you are a fashion historian and I'm wondering when you
thought about all the snipping that Anne did, whether there's somehow to apply
it to the here and now? I think it's a great lesson in valuing cloth, actually.
We are used to a much more disposable way of looking at dress and thinking about
clothes and what this I think teaches us is that we could, in a much more
sustainable way, we could think about clothes much more carefully. And I did
start to, I have got a book at home that I am toying with the idea of gathering
scraps from people I know because I think it's a very tactile way of remembering
people around us. And before I let you go, Victorian women, they might wear
several outfits in a day. How many would you say is the custom, briefly? I think
probably for Anne, she was changing three, maybe four times a day. Oh my
goodness. Yeah, there's a lot of different gowns going on. And so of course then
an awful lot of swatches of fabric that also went into the book. Exactly, yeah,
it's a beauty. And only one of two, is that what I read? There's one at the V&A,
a famous one by Barbara Johnson, but yeah, this is pretty unique. I haven't
found any others here. So lovely to have you in, Kate Strazin, fashion
historian, as I mentioned. And her book is The Dress Diary of Mrs Anne Sykes.
Thanks so much for coming in. A couple of messages coming in about what you
bought yourself after the bad break up. Sarah, I bought myself two rather
expensive designer duvet covers, talking of fabric, which I still love to this
day. My ex couldn't see why we needed luxuries. I also get my nails done every
fortnight. Country Mousy just has two words, what did she buy herself after the
break up? A farm. It helped hugely. I'll see you on Monday. Thanks so much for
tuning in and for all your messages today on Woman's Hour. Woman's Hour was
presented by Nuala McGovern. It was produced by Sarah Crawley and the studio
engineer this morning was Michael Millam. As you heard earlier on Woman's Hour,
Shamima Begum has lost her latest appeal for her citizenship. If you'd like an
even closer look at the background to all this, we've been running a series
called The Shamima Begum Story and we've another episode after the news in a
couple of minutes. Two robbers and three tonnes of gold. Every ring, every
watch. If you're looking for the gold, it's all around you. The Gold Watch.
