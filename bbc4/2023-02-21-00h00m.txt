 by James E. Faylen and a bridge then produced by Mary Ward-Loury. BBC News at
11 o'clock. Police in Lancashire say they have formally identified the body they
found yesterday in the River Wire as Nicola Bully. The death will now be
investigated by the coroner. The 45-year-old was last seen walking her dog more
than three weeks ago in a statement her family thanked the community for their
support but criticised some recent media coverage as absolutely appalling. Steve
Wilkins is a former detective chief superintendent who's investigated some high
profile murders. It is a very difficult balance between meeting the needs of
everybody and sometimes that scrutiny can be very distracting for the force
because the resources that they're using are the same resources that days after
will be patrolling the streets you know they don't have a group of specialists
who are sitting waiting for incidents such as way of seeing. Junior doctors in
England had a go on a three-day strike next month after voting overwhelmingly
for industrial action. Their main union, the British Medical Association, said
almost every one of the 37,000 doctors who cast a ballot voted yes. The health
secretary, Steve Marley said the move was deeply disappointing. Seismologists
have recorded another earthquake near the city of Antichyar in southern
southeastern Turkey where the magnitude of 6.4. Three people have died and more
than 200 have been wounded. More than 46,000 people died after a stronger quake
struck Turkey and Syria two weeks ago. President Biden has paid a surprise visit
to Kiev days before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He
met President Zelensky and during a news conference promised to stand with
Ukraine for as long as it takes. And a vast collection of precious artifacts
stolen from Cambodia decades ago have been returned to the country after
surfacing in London. The crowns, necklaces, amulets and other jewels from the
Angkor period are many centuries old. Thousands of antiques were smuggled out of
the country in the 1970s when Cambodia was ravaged by civil wars and a genocide
carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime. The collection was handed to Cambodian
authorities in a car park in North London. BBC News. Continuing our celebration
of the centenary of BBC Radio drama, the Huntsman now purposefully directed his
footsteps, analyzing the most groundbreaking plays from the vast drama archive.
You can go to different places and tell the stories from different points of
view. Dramatic beats with me, Michael Simmons Roberts. Everything in pretty
storytelling, long television, oh so much to Radio drama. On Radio 4 and BBC
Sounds. On Saturday night at 8. Ah colleagues at Westminster are just putting
the finishing touches to today in Parliament. You can hear their efforts in half
an hour, though word of mouth with Michael Rosen. My father was partly brought
up by his grandfather Joe. Joe had been born in Poland. One story that my father
used to like telling us was how as a boy he used to sit with his grandfather
helping him read an English newspaper. When my father told us the story he would
imitate his grandfather's accent and tell us how he would explain to his
grandfather what the words in the newspaper meant. I know this has to be a
memory of when my father was a boy because his grandfather died in 1932 when my
father was 13. I often think about this moment. My father as a boy acting as a
bridge between the generations between cultures between languages. Since then
I've sat in the waiting room at the doctors or in hospital and seen children
with their parents or grandparents doing just the same. A doctor or nurse talks
to the adult and the child, sometimes as young as 8 or 9 or 10, interpreting for
them. I've often wondered about the responsibility of this. What if the doctor
is wanting to tell the adult about a life-threatening illness or something very
complicated and technical? I had one glimpse of this myself albeit when I was an
adult. My father had a heart attack in France and he was rushed to hospital. I
got on a plane and went straight there. Rather arrogantly I thought I could
handle any language problems. The doctor explained to me that my father had had
an anaphachthus. I thought, what's that? Didn't my stepmother say that he had a
heart attack? Am I going to have to tell him he's had anaphachthus instead? The
doctor looked at my puzzled face. Anaphachthus said during the police car the
act he explained, anaphachthus is a heart attack, a coronary thrombosis. Yes so
much for my skills as a medical interpreter. Now they're not easy these moments
far from it and someone who's had to negotiate them many times is my guest on
the program today. San Meet Core. Welcome to the program, San Meet. Thank you
Michael. Now let's go back to the beginning. Where's your family from? So my
family's from Afghanistan. My dad is from Kabul and my mum is from Jalalabad
which is not too far from the border in Pakistan. And when did your family come
to England? My family came to England in 2000 so just before the war on terror
and following the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s. So how old was everybody?
How old were your parents at the time? My parents I think were in their late
20s. I was five and my older sister was around seven and a half at the time.
Right and what was the family language or perhaps several family languages? So
my parents both can speak farcee which is spoken in Afghanistan but at home we
spoke Punjabi because we're Afghan Sikhs and Sikhs speak Punjabi which is from
India. So we spoke at mixture the dialect we spoke was actually a mixture of
farcee and Punjabi. Is that got a name or is he just say it's a mixture? Yeah
it's called Garbly so it kind of goes from like Garbil which is the place where
a lot of the Afghan Sikhs live. I get you right and when your parents came could
they speak in the English? No none of us could speak English or four of us we
had no grasp of the English language. Not at all, not a word no. Not at all no.
Right so you were five then straight into school? Yep so when we got here
because we were asylum seekers the only house in the good fine for us that the
time was a Newcastle which didn't have a huge Sikh community and in London there
was a Sikh community so we'd hoped to be in London but instead we moved to
Newcastle where we were completely isolated and yeah me and my sister went to
school not speaking a word of English. Was it frightening? Yeah I was terrified
I couldn't understand what the teachers were saying to me and I was also in a
completely new environment and I was a little brown girl and I was surrounded by
majority white kids who weren't very nice especially in the aftermath of the war
on terror. There was a lot of racism happening that I witnessed that my parents
were going through and then that obviously feeds down to kids and how they
behave and the vocabulary they use in school. I remember I was five years old
and I could I could understand what they were saying when they were like go back
home I seem to pick that up very quickly which was pretty horrible which was
really horrible. And how long were you there in Newcastle school? So I was there
for about a year? In that year do you think you were fairly fluent at English
but at the end of it I'm just getting? Yeah I think it took about six months to
like grasp the language because I went to school every day so I was having
intensive sessions in English and how to learn it I guess. And were they
teaching you English or did you just pick it up in the playground pick it up in
lessons just as it unfolded? It was a bit of both I remember I had a teaching
assistant who was assigned to me to help me in school which was really nice. It
was really funny because I think she was Muslim and they thought because I came
from Afghanistan she'd be able to speak to me in far as I could understand far
as the only new DiPajabi dialect that we spoke so Blas said she was really
helpful but the school would assume that we could speak the same language and
that that wasn't the case. Right so at this moment while you're still in
Newcastle mum and dad are either of them going out to work? Yeah so my dad was
working because he had to work to you know help her survive as a family so my
dad was picking up bits of the language I think the job he got was with someone
else who was from the community so I think he went to the Good Warra found his
contacts and then found someone who could speak Hindi and got a job. That's the
temple is it the Good Warra? Yeah the Good Warra is a Sikh temple. Right I see
so then that year comes to an end and you go to London. Yeah. And is that
different for you linguistically? Yeah little bit there was more of a community
so my parents wouldn't always need me to support them they had other family
members to support them if they needed but in a lot of ways it was quite similar
because I was near my sister with the primary contact for my parents for the
outside world especially my mum. And now at this moment you're bilingual then
aren't you because you're speaking one or possibly two languages at home and
English at school? Yeah yeah yeah definitely. So are you immediately thrown into
situations with either your mum or your dad? We are acting as an interpreter so
let's say Dr. Surgeries. Yeah definitely that was one of my first interactions
where I remember being terrified that I had this role where I was that bridge
that you mentioned earlier between my mum and the outside world so my mum became
pregnant when we got to the UK so my little sister who's now 21. Yeah she was
born in 2001 and in the lead up to her birth my mum had obviously lots of
medical appointments and it was very tricky for her to get an interpreter I
don't think there was like funding available or like the appointments would take
much longer if we'd waited for the council to provide an interpreter so it would
often be me and my sister because we'd picked up English much quicker by being
in school we would be that bridge so I would stick with my mum and the doctors
office and try and translate what was going on for her whether she was cramping
or anything else and a lot of like kind of logical stuff that as an adult I'm
having a struggle with understanding but as a five year old so many technical
words that I just didn't obviously I couldn't grasp. I mean how did you do that
I mean it just take the word contraction so this is being thrown up to five year
old did the doctor then say well it's a kind of squeezy thing and then you
thought squeeze oh yes I can say that. I think it was yeah working together with
the doctors trying to figure out what exactly we were getting I do I think I
probably said pain in this area and like it was a bit of a work in progress
between me and the doctor trying to figure out exactly what we were getting at
and it was guesswork for both of us I guess. And was it funny I mean or was it
usually a bit more tense than that? I think it was quite stressful because I
think we both could feel my mum's frustration and not being able to advocate for
herself so it was it was quite tricky I think for the doctor for myself and my
mum because she was in pain so that that was quite tricky I think. I suppose the
one thing going for us that she had had two babies before. So she did sort of
know the rope says it were. Yeah yeah exactly I think the thing that was really
stressful to her she was in a whole new country and that was really really
stressful about how to navigate you know the mental strain of coming to a new
country as a refugee alongside being pregnant so I think it was the mental and
physical strains at that time that we got her down. But what about you? I mean
I'm just imagining you know most five six-year-olds the idea of mummy having a
baby it's amazing it's incredible how can it be you know they're sort of it's
amazing mystery and also very exciting and then you know you get a cop ready for
this baby but you're you you're almost kind of vicariously pregnant yourself as
a five-year-old I mean just to put it very bluntly. Yeah it was it was quite
strange thinking back now actually I don't I don't remember being excited for it
at all I was very nervous. I took in a lot of my mum's anxiety around the whole
pregnancy I guess because I was interpreting it for her so I felt very closely
linked to it myself. And did anybody seem embarrassed by you being there the
midwives or the doctors or indeed your mum did your mum sort of think well I
wouldn't normally be explaining this to a five-year-old. I think everyone was I
think everyone realized what an unfortunate unfair situation it was for all of
us to be in and I think my mum would have really liked to land the language
herself but we came to the UK at a time where I mean there's still is a lot of
hostility towards refugees and she was terrified to go outside she was really
really scared and it was also at a time when easel funding you know English is
an additional language funding was was being slashed so she didn't really have a
chance to get out there and learn the language for herself I'm sure she would
have absolutely loved to be able to advocate for herself and speak for herself.
And we didn't have Zoom in those days do we? We did not know. Yes other remote
systems are available. Yes so let's move on now to matters to do with
immigration citizenship and the like were you drawn into those as well because
obviously you're seeking asylum so you're looking for leave to remain I'm just
coming out with phrases that presumably as a six-seven year old you're learning
how to hop between the languages with yes is that right? Yeah definitely so when
we were initially a Newcastle I don't remember much of having to like regale the
story I guess because it was sort of like written down these are people being
placed in this housing because X-1's that has happened to them but then when we
came to London because we were looking for housing at that point we were
essentially homeless for a little bit because the council hadn't found us
housing so we'd be going from different councils explaining why we needed
housing and I just remember being sat in like you know a certain council's
office and as a five-year-old having to describe what my parents had been
through going up in Afghanistan and why we had to leave and why we as Afghan
Sikhs had to flee because as a religious minority we were persecuted and yeah I
was describing trauma that even as an adult I'm just beginning to process but as
a five-year-old it was so it was seeding to my mind that narrative and was your
the way that worked was it that your mum would tell the story your mum or dad
would tell the story and then you would relay it or did you already kind of have
it off by heart and so they would turn to you and say well how did you get here?
It was definitely my mum and dad asking me to translate for them but yeah and it
did change for like different people that we were speaking to as well so if it
was often it might just be just my mum that they wanted to speak to or just my
dad that they wanted to speak to and then now it is would obviously be different
for example one of the biggest threats that my mum faced was as a woman in
Afghanistan it was very tricky for her to leave the house by herself on
chaperoned so her interaction with the outside world was different to my dad who
my dad was a merchant and he would go out and work and my dad has traveled to
Russia for example that's where he would go from Afghanistan and he could speak
Russia so like the different stories my dad came out with yeah they were quite
different to what my mum would talk about and also presumably when you were
encountering officials or indeed legal officers on your behalf there's a
verification issue they're trying to find out with you're telling the truth or
not and so they're trying to see whether the story's match up and I mean whether
you knew it or not you were being tested in effect yeah yeah definitely and I do
remember my parents relaying that to me telling me how serious that was like
telling me this role that had was really serious because I was the voice for the
family so you know before we'd go into this meeting my parents would say this is
what's happening here this is what we're trying to get across as in our
citizenship for this country is dependent on your translating skills essentially
or what you're able to get across which was really scary as a child it was a lot
of pressure to be under I'm just picturing that you know two adults we you know
as I'm a parent so I know of the kind of conversations I've had with five year
olds you know about programs who watch you on the telly and you know what game
are we going to play later and here is something that is a matter of family
survival with incredibly important consequences and I can see them somehow you
know adults up here you down there small and you're watching them staring at
their faces and trying to remember this and think about it it seems such a huge
burden I mean it's nobody's fault but it's just that's the way it was yeah
definitely you know something I've like covered a lot in therapy over the last
few years that parent child role reversal because that's essentially what it was
instead of me looking to my parents for guidance it was sort of the other way
around when my parents were looking to me and I had this great responsibility um
yeah it's been quite a lot to try and process that level of responsibility and
did you ever say to that your parents I will actually now I shouldn't say that I
would say this you know I can see say a six seven year old moving on from when
you're five that you might have said well no let's not talk about that story
let's mention this or something like that did you as it were intervene in what
it was they were giving you that you were going to then give to authorities yeah
definitely I think as I grew up I became a bit more wiser about how the UK works
the bureaucratic system works and was able to advise them essentially and become
an advisor at a certain point being like I think this is the route we should go
down or this is a route we shouldn't go down incredible and were your parents
proud of you did they say you're doing wonderfully San Mate or was it just part
of everyday life or maybe they're not like that um I think it was pretty much
expected we all work together as a family it's like having a resource and a day
is just to be expected um so yeah yeah I think they are proud now that you know
I've gone on to university and like did my education and stuff so I think they
know that having the language and english has really helped me to like make you
know a place for myself in this country which is quite nice whatever metaphor
one uses for bilingualism sometimes people say it's like living in two houses or
that you have two heads I only get a little glimpse of it because of where I
speak French those you can see from my story at the beginning it's a bit
imperfect um that you've been somebody who's had the benefit of having these two
heads two houses yeah yeah definitely and I think that's made my world so much
bigger in so many ways um but also in a way um it has meant that I feel much
further away from my parents than I initially did because the more english I
learned the further away I got from them because my way of understanding the
world was different um which has been quite sad to see to see that happen as
well that distance grow between the family because when my two younger sisters
were born so one was born pretty soon after we came to the UK and then I had
another sister um who is now 16 and they have grown up learning english and
speaking english much more frequently than they would speak Punjabi um so at
home when it's all four sisters of us were all speaking in english and my
parents were very shut out of that my dad can sort of catch on to what we're
saying because he's picked up bits and bobs but my mum's still can't speak the
language so I think she feels quite far away from all of us uh which is quite
sad to see I think yes did um teachers at school know so between the age of say
five and 18 you know before you go off to uni um did teachers know you were
acting as this interpreter um I think initially they probably wouldn't have but
then when it came around to parents evening they would absolutely pick up on it
because my mum would come along um and I would have to sit and interpret for my
mum and that worked out quite well in my favour I think um I was quite a chatty
little little person and did you fib of course I did um of course I was going to
use it to my advantage other so when a teacher said really soundmate has been
chatting away at the back of the class I'm not really doing very well and you've
turned your mum and said the teacher says I've been doing absolutely brilliantly
yeah yeah I'd be like I'm such a hard work a mum and um did teachers ever in a
sense praise you for this I'm just interested to see the status of this these
acts of interpreting and being bilingual did you ever get a sense of yourself as
a child and as a teenager you know I'm actually doing something quite special
here yeah I think so I had a look back at all my school reports recently and the
word that keeps cropping up is mutual. Sandmee is very mature for her age and I
think that it did require me to grow up very quickly and learn to advocate for
my family and myself as well so when I was in school I figured out which tools I
would need to use to get ahead essentially and I remember I got to 16 and I'd
seen a um a private school that I was offering a scholarship and I sat there and
applied for all myself and I filled out why we needed financial why I needed it
to be funded and to get the scholarship I got my dad HMRC forms and filled out
all myself and I got a scholarship place at this private school for two years
before I went off to uni and that was amazing that I was able to advocate for
myself and um I think my parents were really proud of me at that point for for
learning how to navigate a system that is sort of rigged against people from my
background and use it to my advantage I guess. So that's all on the positive
side uh with their times say when you were a teen um you were resentful you were
annoyed maybe even envious of your friends that didn't have to do this sort of
thing I mean I'm not going to imagine a situation in which you might want to go
out dancing having a great time and you've got to filling some forms instead.
Yeah of course I had a lot of responsibility so with my two younger sisters
arriving of course then it meant their doctors appointments that I would have to
go to with my mum and I had to make sure I got home on time for x y z
appointment that we had to attend I couldn't miss behaving school because I
couldn't afford to get a detention because then it would have implications for
my family and all the adamant that I needed to be done and I remember at one
point. That's a real restriction of freedom it's not being able to miss behaving
school. I know right I remember when my younger sister was born um I had to miss
a few lessons in school to go to the doctor's appointment with her and my mum
because she was quite my little sister was quite ill and I had her on my lap and
I was explaining to the doctor this is what's wrong with Rhea at this point and
the doctor referred to me as mum and I was 12 years old at that point and my mum
was sat next to me and I was like oh no and she was referring to my mum as
grandma I was so embarrassed I was I was really really resentful at that point
because I was like why can my mum not do this herself why am I being put in this
awkward situation especially as a 12 year old everything is embarrassing let
alone someone thinking your little sister's mum um and I think that did create a
bit of frustration between me and my mum where like doctor's appointments would
come up and I'd be like I'm not going and she would because I was just so tired
of it all I guess um and also I was in a phase of teenage rebellion where
everything my parents said I'd be like no um and I think that was quite tricky
and upsetting for my mum I look back now and I'm like that that was not very
nice of teenage me um and my dad would then have to take time off work to go
with her um but that would also be hard because my dad can speak English but he
thinks that his accent or the fact that it's broken English um people don't
really respect what he has to say so often even now he'll call me and say can
you call this person because they're much likely to listen to you given your
accent and your voice rather than me um so I think he found it quite frustrating
if he had to go with my mum to talk to the point miss just because it was almost
the same in terms of how much they'd be believed or understood. And I'm thinking
here now of writing I mean I go dad speak English a bit sounds like he's doing
okay uh but presumably writing is pretty difficult for him. Uh yeah yeah yeah
he's just about learning actually what's that has been very interesting in this
because through what's at my parents have been able to copy and post certain
words and also emojis are so helpful so when we're talking now um this morning I
met in my dad and I was like hello good morning how are you and who applied with
the smiley emoji so that's nice and voice notes are also helpful. And just today
I've got completely lost with a form let's not say who from okay from a utility
firm let me say I got completely lost with it I couldn't understand it I mean
are you the interpreter for the forms that come in from utilities they're pretty
difficult to understand. Yeah my dad will send me a photo and what's up and then
I'll give him a call and run through it um and it is quite hard because when I
do go home there's a stack of letters waiting for me to sort of sit through with
him and work them through and it also means like we can often get behind on
bills because he hasn't understood the urgency written in next wine said letter
and that's always quite hard to see because obviously you know with the cost of
living crisis going on people getting behind on things people at my family who
might not be able to understand it would be a massive struggle. Yeah so you're
intervening on that front as well perhaps you could do it for me too. Yes I see
so look let's come to now are you as bilingual as you ever were or have you lost
some of your particular form of Punjabi because you're chatting to your sisters
and you're out here in an English speaking world. I've definitely lost bits of
my Punjabi that only time I now speak it is when talking to my mum because to my
dad I would speak in English and he'll respond to Punjabi but because I know you
can understand what I'm saying I'm so lazy um I just speak in English and I
think I realized it when I was at school that the voice in my head was um
English and it initially used to be Punjabi and that's when I realized that
English has very much become my first language in many ways. So you think your
bum is actually inching towards a bit of English? I think so yeah I think like
through the years listening to all of us talk she has caught onto satin phrases
and stuff uh which which is quite nice. And just to be sexist about it shopping
maybe does she handle shopping? No you're laughing at me. My mum is actually
quite worried about going outside by herself um still because she's really
worried that someone will talk to her in English and she wouldn't be able to
reply so she doesn't really go shopping by herself. It will either be with my
dad or with me and my sisters and because I've got three other sisters there's a
lot of people there to help her out if she needs. So I wave the magic wand and I
provide the help and assistance that we can give your mother to learn English.
What is that magic wand? What is it? Is it you spending a day a week teaching
her or is it a special teacher who comes into the home or is it a remote call to
a teacher? What's what's the magic wand that I can wave? Oh the magic wand
probably not me I'm a bit tired maybe someone else coming in and teaching her
that would be nice just because I would love for her to have the independence. I
think she feels quite restricted so the magic wand would be someone coming in
teaching her. The idea of your mother being afraid to go to the shop said this
is bugging me. Yeah I think she's got into the point where she's had so much
support she's kind of like I've passed my age of learning. We're just kind of
back to see she's in her fifties. Well I'm learning a language so it's possible.
I know. Yeah I need to get that across to her don't I? Yeah so my core is in
still in it. Yeah I'm learning a language and remotely so it's as possible. My
teachers in New York. Oh amazing. It's incredible the world has changed for
language learners so. And I think it'll also be important my partner he doesn't
speak Punjabi he's Scottish he's white so my partner is actually trying to learn
Punjabi at the moment because he wants in future to be able to converse with my
mum that would be quite nice. So yeah it'd be nice for her to do the other way
around as well. Yes yeah. So looking back on yourself now how can I put it? When
you when you were a teenager you got annoyed sometimes you had roused with your
mum about it. Are you are you more sort of understanding about that situation
now? I mean you don't want to have roused with it presumably I mean you're a
different relationship as you are when you become an adult. I think I look back
at it now with a lot of sympathy for my parents because they were put in a
really horrible situation they arrived in the UK as refugees essentially and
they really struggled and the fact that I was able to help out is fine in my
book if I was able to do that. And you don't blame your parents for employing
their five-year-old anymore I mean obviously you know need to master you have to
work with what's possible you were one of the family's resources I think it's
more or less the way you put it. Do you feel somehow that if you were in that
situation do you think you would turn to a five-year-old? That's very tricky. I
don't I don't think I would but that's because I haven't come from a war-torn
country in the same way my parents have I wasn't traumatized in the way that
they were so I can totally imagine why they went down the easy simplest route I
suppose because they have a lot more trauma that they were grappling with at
that time but it does make me think about kids today who are having to do that
we should be putting more resource into supporting those families whether it's
mental health support or support with translation as well because I don't think
it was something unique that happened to me I think it was something that
happened before me and continues to happen now as well. And why isn't there this
sport because sometimes I've heard politicians say are well to trouble with some
migrant families as they speak to each other in their home language and it isn't
English and this is holding them back. Learning a new language means sitting
there opening your brain up and being open to new possibilities how can you do
that when you are feeling so horrible on the inside if you've come from you know
a war-torn country your mental state is not going to be open to learning lots of
new stuff so I think that goes hand in hand with mental health support. So
that's your plea. That is my plea. Send me call thanks very much for coming on
the program. Thank you for having me Michael. Word of mouth wears presented by
Michael Rosen and produced in Bristol by Sally Heaven. Nearly a year on how can
peace be restored in Europe? This will end when there is enough progress on the
battlefield by Ukraine. A war that has to be won or a broken peace. This is
James Nachte and in Europe and the United States I've been talking to
negotiators about the lessons from the past. You've had a 70 year armistice in
Korea but what you've not had is 70 years of a quiet calm border. Every war is
different. So how might understanding old conflict help you create with both
sidespeak of nothing but victory? How wars end on BBC Radio 4 available now on
BBC Science? Now on Radio 4 to Westminster there's two former prime ministers
join forces. Today in Parliament. Order. Order. Good evening this is Susan
Hymatt Westminster where two former prime ministers pile pressure on Rishi Sunak
to provide Ukraine with fighter planes. I can't wait to see the tanks and I
can't wait to see the fighter jets in Ukraine to help those brave Ukrainians. We
should give them what they need not next month not next year but now. And
following violent demonstrations against asylum seekers in Nulcley, Labour
accuses Suela Breveman of using inflammatory words. Some of the home secretary's
language has also appeared on some of the placards and I'd say on all sides we
need to have a calm debate. But first MPs including Boris Johnson and Liz trusts
have urged the government to equip Ukraine with fighter jets as the first
anniversary of Russia's invasion approaches. Earlier this month Ukraine's
presence Zelensky addressed both houses of Parliament with a plea for the West
to send planes as well as tanks and other weaponry already being supplied. Liz
trusts added her voice to the call from military jets in what was her first
speech in the Commons since resigning as prime minister. The debate was opened
by the foreign secretary James Cleverley who made no promise of aircraft but
said that one year on from present Putin's invasion countries must not hold back
in helping Ukraine. This is exactly the right moment for Ukraine to seize the
advantages. That is why we and our allies must step up our effort to ensure that
Ukraine wins this war and secures a lasting peace. The Conservative former
Cabinet Minister Simon Clark interrupted he wondered whether we actually had the
weaponry to send. Can he commit that we are reassessing as a matter of urgency
our defence stocks which must be severely depleted at this juncture to make sure
we can sustain the effort however long it takes. The Foreign Secretary said this
was precisely the conflict from which the UK had these weapons. We were
fortunate it was Ukrainian and not British troops who were having to use them
so. If anyone in the international community or amongst our allies was thinking
of holding back their stocks for a rainy day this is the rainy day. But another
Conservatives are Edward Lee asked. At Resolute are we are we going to give them
airplanes? The Foreign Secretary didn't answer that directly but he said that
this year we shall at very least match the £2.3 billion of military aid we gave
last year and we shall add more advanced capabilities across land across sea and
across air. But the Conservative former Prime Minister Liz Trust who was formed
secretary when Russia invaded Ukraine was clear that the UK didn't need to do
more. She said Britain had done all it could to get weapons to Ukraine as fast
as possible and now she couldn't wait to see tanks and fighter jets helping
Ukraine. We need to do all we can to make sure Ukraine wins this war as soon as
possible. Every extra day a live lost women violated towns destroyed. We need to
do all we can as fast as we can. My view is that does include fighter jets. The
government has been prepared to train Ukrainian fighter pilots but Liz Trust his
predecessor in Downing Street Boris Johnson felt that was half-hearted. It's
admirable that we're proposing to train Ukrainian fighters to fly NATO. Fast
jets I hear the caution of my honourable friend but it's curious that we're
doing this before we've even taken the decision in principle to give them the
planes. Let's cut to the chase and give them the planes too. The shadow Foreign
Secretary David Lamy was determined to show that the opposition was in the face
of Russian aggression on the government's side. Britain stands united behind
Ukraine and in that spirit I want to pay tribute to the Foreign Secretary and
the defence secretary and to our two former prime ministers who deserve credit
for the roles that they have played. And he wanted to see an end to the peace
millenouncements of more military aid. If Ukraine is going to prevail over what
Putin will throw at it, the UK and our allies should set aside individual
announcements and instead lay out a long-term strategy to provide the support
that Ukraine needs. Whether it be ammunition, additional air defence
capabilities or NATO standard weaponry. A former Labour Minister Liam Byrne
hoped the government was listening to what he said was a clear call from two
former prime ministers. Otherwise there would be more loss of life from a
grinding ground war with strikes on civilian targets. There is this extended
time period between the saying no and then the saying yes. So on air defence we
said no to Patriot missiles until it was that we said yes. On tanks we said no
until months and months later we said yes. Now can we please just short circuit
the process of sending in the F-16s as fast as possible with trained pilots.
Speaking for the SNP, Dave Dugan wondered if the UK really had the capacity even
to train Ukrainian pilots. I am pleased up to a certain extent that the United
Kingdom is training combat air pilots for Ukraine. But I am left wondering to
forehand and I am also wondering what is happening to the combat air pilots in
training with the Royal Air Force. Some of whom are not making the surplus to
deputy speaker. Some of whom are having to wait eight or even nine years to
become qualified. And for the Lib Dems Richard Ford said Ukraine should not
always have to ask for equipment. We should not be answering each and every
request on this reactive basis. There are times when we should be supplying
equipment pervertively. Although he said it would be a symbolic gesture if the
UK were to send fast jets to Kiev because he understood that it was Swedish
gripping jets that the country really needed. Perhaps it was a sign of the unity
of the commons over Ukraine but the debate was relatively thinly attended and
finished early with almost two hours to spare. Now opposition MPs have accused
the government of stoking up community tensions through inflammatory language
and by housing large groups of asylum seekers and hotels. It follows the violent
scenes that are protest outside a hotel in Merseyside, Christina Cooper reports.
10 days ago at a demonstration outside a hotel in Nozley housing asylum seekers,
three people were injured and a police vehicle was set on fire. The commons was
on a week's break at the time but on the first day back events in Merseyside
were raised by the MP for Nozley, Labour's Sajorj Howarth. He said the
demonstration was attended by a substantial number of residents. Many of whom
conducted themselves peacefully and lawfully, unfortunately, so did not as the
number of arrests made regrettably illustrates. This is not how the typical of
the people of Nozley or Kirby who are not bigoted, racist or unwelcoming. He
said far right groups from outside the area had tried to stir up racial hatred
and he asked the government to consider banning them. The immigration minister
Robert Genrick told him that the home office had been monitoring these groups
very closely and would take further action if needed. The behaviour of those
groups is at times disgraceful, vile and should be stamped out. He said no one
wanted to see hotels used as a accommodation for asylum seekers. This is an
emergency temporary solution to a serious national emergency. The number of
individuals crossing the channel illegally in recent years. It's been on such a
scale that the home office had to resort to options which are clearly
undesirable. The government has promised laws to stop people arriving in the UK
in small boats. A conservative Sir Bill Wigan felt ministers were doing
everything they could and turned his fire on the most senior civil servant in
the home office. Can my right honks look friend explain why the permanent
secretary is still in post and no small bill, the small boat spill has appeared
before that. The minister replied that it was important to take time to ensure
the legislation was as effective as possible. It is an area where I'm afraid
human rights lawyers do abuse and exploit our laws at times and where the courts
have taken an expansive approach in the past. Labo's shadow homes secretary of
Etcupa linked what happened in Nozley to events in Dover last October when a man
through petrol bombs at a centre for processing migrants. So called migrant
hunts organised by far right groups have doubled in the last year and an
increase there's been an increase in far right groups organising protests and
intimidation and attempting to increase in flame community tensions. All of us
have a responsibility to take this seriously. And she said everyone had a
responsibility to talk about the issues in a way that didn't inflame tensions. I
know that he will regret the fact that some of the home secretary's language has
also appeared. On side of the placards and I'd say on all sides we need to have
a calm debate. Last November Suella Braverman referred to the arrival of asylum
seekers in small boats as an invasion on the southern coast. The minister said
the home secretary had condemned the violence unequivocally. That does not mean
that we should not seek to understand the level of public frustration that lies
behind wider concerns about our asylum and immigration system. A conservative
Matt Worman was worried about a planned protest in Skegnes in his constituency
at the weekend. Will he join with me in appealing to the people of Skegnes to
focus rightly on those issues but not to join hands with far right groups? The
minister said his constituents were frustrated by the use of hotels in Skegnes
but he knew they wouldn't want to join with far right groups to stoke disorder.
Speaking for the SNP, Alison Thulis said the use of hotels had a loud right-wing
extremist groups to target vulnerable people. It's home office policy therefore
that it's putting people at risk. Not just those vulnerable asylum seekers that
are there but also are police who have then got to go and protect everybody in
that situation. An accusation rejected by the minister. That is both wrong and
deeply offensive. The issue here are the number of people crossing the channel
illegally. Those are it is not the backlog. The honourable lady says from a
sedentary position it is the backlog. That is a fantasy. At the end of last year
there was a backlog of 117,000 asylum cases. The minister insisted that
processing claims faster wouldn't solve the problem. He said the UK needed a
more robust approach to illegal migration, including removing people who arrived
illegally to a safe third country. A reference to the government's ambition to
transfer people to Rwanda to have their claims processed. Kristin Kupur
reporting. Labour has asked if funding to improve housing in England will be
blocked by the Chancellor. Concerns about value for money means that the
Treasury has tightened controls on spending by the Department of leveling up
housing and communities, headed by Michael Gove. In the comments his labour
shadow, Lisa Nandy, wondered what the effect would be. The Secretary's state no
longer has the power to sign off on a park bench. And there are now reports of
significant underspends in his department that are about to be clawed back by
the Treasury. So, can he guarantee that to the towns, crying out for investment
in town centres in high streets and in affordable housing, that the full
allocation of the towns fund, the future high streets fund and the affordable
homes program will be spent. Michael Gove insisted the money was being spent. It
is absolutely the case that this department is responsible for the disbursement
successfully, of funds to the front line, which are helping to transform
communities, which have been overlooked and undervalued by the last government.
No one is going to get in the way of this department spending the money that we
need on the communities that needed. But many MPs were disgruntled at where
money was being spent. Last month there was controversy over the latest
allocation of leveling up funding. Labour's Judith Cummins noted that the Prime
Minister's local authority of Richmondshire in Yorkshire was the 67th least
deprived. While Spratford is the 21st most deprived, Sir Minister was leveling
up at the heart of the government's decision to approve, roughly 20 million
pounds of funding to Richmondshire and no funding for my constituency of
Bradford South. That money went to ensure that service families get the
accommodation and the support that they deserve. If Labour want to be taken
seriously as a patriotic party, they should stop talking down our armed forces
and make sure they receive the money they deserve. That failed to persuade the
S&P's Peter Grant, the MP for Glen Rosses. Can the Secretary of State identify a
single measure of needed deprivation by folks? The Prime Minister's constituency
is as needy and is deprived as a legal might be the American State Council and
is more deprived than the entire city of Glasgow? Michael Goev said leveling up
money had gone to both Glasgow and Glen Rosses. A conservative Mark Prichard had
a question about planning rules, in particular solar farms. Solar is an
important part of the UK's energy mix and as the Secretary of State will know,
the sun always shines in Yorkshire. But does he agree with me that having those
solar farms often at a huge scale need to be in the right place, not the wrong
place, and so often a lot of good agricultural land is being lost? Michael Goev
fondly remembered the pastoral scenes in a structure lad. Trotcher, home to the
blue remembered Hills of A. Houseman, is one of our most beautiful counties and
it is vitally important that even as we pursue renewable energy across the
United Kingdom, that we also recognise that our environment is just as much
about natural beauty as it is towards thriving towards net zero. The community's
secretary, Michael Goev, you're listening to today in Parliament with me Susan
Hume still to come a challenge for the sports minister. Instead of constantly
passing it back, can he just put the ball into the back of the net? But first,
the Iranian regime has been roundly condemned in the commons after threats
against UK-based journalists forced a TV news channel to relocate to the United
States. Iran International said it had received warnings for Scotland Yard that
there were grave concerns about hostile intentions of foreign states. Alicia
McCarthy has the details. Making a statement in the commons, the Security
Minister Tom Tuyinhat told MPs that in recent months the Iranian regime had
publicly called for the capture or killing of those holding it to account,
including those working in the UK for Iran International, a Persian language
news channel. The Home Secretary and I absolutely condemned this outrageous
violation of our sovereignty and the attempted violation of the human rights of
those journalists. The channel had stopped broadcasting from the UK switching
instead to its offices in the United States, but Tom Tuyinhat was determined
that would only be a temporary move, insisting freedom of the press was at the
heart of our freedoms. Tehran's efforts to silence Iran International are a
direct attack on our freedoms and an attempt to undermine our sovereignty. They
will fail. The minister said since the stars of 2022 the UK had responded to
what he called 15 credible threats by the Iranian regime to kill or kidnap
British and UK-based people. He said the foreign secretary James Cleverley had
already summoned the deputy ambassador for a meeting and the UK will be looking
at further sanctions on those linked to the Iranian regime. Fileba Holly Lynch
wanted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard call the IRGC, a branch of the Iranian
armed forces added to a list of terrorist groups. The UK must always be a safe
place for journalists to speak truth to power. The rest of the world is
watching. We cannot ever allow for authoritarian tyranny to be exported to the
UK and conducted on behalf of other hostile states within our own borders. Holly
Lynch also called for tougher sanctions. Tom Tuyinhat said the UK and its
international partners had just imposed further measures on eight senior Iranian
figures and from the dispatch box he addressed the Iranian regime directly. We
will hold you to account for your blatant violation of our laws and our values.
We will expose your crimes against the British people and against the Iranian
people. We will expose your actions around the world. We will work with our
allies to hold you to account personally and we will act to keep our country
safe. Speaking for the SNP, Alison Thule said her party was alarmed and deeply
disturbed by the serious threats to UK-based journalists by the Iranian regime.
We all agreed that it had gratitude to the brave independent Iranian
journalists, particularly those from Iran and international who have shown a
light in the recent protest movements and shown the world the continuous and
shocking human rights abuses of the Iranian security forces and the Iranian
regime. She too urged the Minister to prescribe the IRGC saying it was a source
of great uncertainty and fear for many Iranians living in the UK. They don't
know where they are safe and that should not be the situation for anybody who
has come to live in these islands. They should be able to go about their lives
in Glasgow or anybody else without feeding who might be coming to get them
without having to look over their shoulder. Iran International was broadcasting
from a business park in the West London constituency of Labour MP Ruth Cadbury.
She said the channel was grateful for what the Metropolitan Police had done to
keep its journalists and the wider public safe. But she asked, What is the
government doing to ensure that journalists are never again forced to leave
their workplace in my constituency and across the country in order to protect
the rest of the public? The Minister said attempts were being made to find a new
site for Iran International in the UK as to her question. The reality is we need
to do more to protect journalists in this country. It's absolutely clear that we
have more to do and that is why the Prime Minister asked me to set up the
defending democracy task force. We'll be coming out with suggestions very soon.
A Conservative MP and former soldier Bob Stewart asked about comments the
Minister had made earlier accusing the Iranian intelligence services of working
with organised crime gangs. My full of the fact that Colonel Gaddafi's
terrorists used to work quite closely with the provisional IRA is my honourable
friend able to say anything about whether there are indications that such links
are happening between Iranian terrorists and actually homegrown terrorists. Tom
Tuggen had said there were many different connections between criminals,
terrorists and hostile states, but he'd rather not say any more in public about
those links. Alyssia McCarthy Now adult social care is an issue that said to
effect around 10 million people in England. It's also one Boris Johnson said his
government would fix once and for all. But more than three years on there's
impatience about the rate of progress. Lord Lemings, an independent peer who
sits on a Lord's committee on adult social care and he wanted to highlight the
situation of friends and family members who provide care for free. Unpaid carers
feel that they carry a huge burden but are largely unappreciated and ignored.
Indeed one wrote only last week saying that after years and years of nursing
experience, I now feel completely worn out and very lonely. The health and care
minister Lord Markham shared his own experience. As an unpaid care for a number
of years myself I'm personally familiar with the circumstances and familiar with
the fact that they are the backbone of the social care sector. He's out
ministers where moving in the right direction on plans for England. We've made
up to 7.5 billion available over two years to put the sector on a stronger
financial footing, improve access to social care and address workforce
pressures. We will publish further details this spring setting out how we intend
to make improvements to the system. A Libdam Lady Barker recalled Sadgy Javid's
time as health secretary. He stated publicly what some of us had long suspected
which is that we have a health and social care system which is predicated on the
assumption that people will primarily be looked after by their families. A
million people are aging without children. They don't have close family to look
after them. Why not his department acknowledge the existence of this group of
people? Lord Markham sought the increased spending was an acknowledgement that
more and more people would be facing that situation. A conservative former
cabinet minister Lord for SITH asked a pointed question. Given that the
government promised that we will fix social care and given the answer to his
question that there are 10 million people affected, is it wise to go into a
general election without having done so? As ever I think my noble friend for his
friendly questions. No, we know that this is an area that needs to be addressed
and I think it is an area that we are addressing. The health and care minister
Lord Markham. The sports minister has said he'll publish the government's
proposals to change the rules on the way football in England is run later this
week. But MPs complained that the process had already taken too long and some
clubs were on the brink of collapse. Here's Mandy Baker. A review commissioned
by ministers and led by fans into how football is governed was completed in
November 2021. It made 10 recommendations, including establishing an independent
regulator and imposing stricter tests for prospective owners. The news that the
government's proposals in response to that were about to be published didn't
impress Labour's shadow sports secretary Lucy Powell. She said they were
promised five months ago. So will the government take responsibility for the
clubs that go bust spiral into decline or which are brought bought by unsuitable
new owners in the years they've wasted bringing the regulator in. A metaphor was
on its way. Parliament fully supports these proposals. Labour is fully committed
to them. The minister is facing an open goal. So instead of constantly passing
it back, can he just put the ball into the back of the net? The sports minister
Stuart Andrew said he wasn't going to apologise for making sure the government's
proposals actually addressed what were complex issues. The opposition may think
that they could just simply publish a report like in just a week but I have
taken a considerable amount of time. I have taken a considerable amount of time
and I'm glad that I have a considerable amount of time to meet with all of the
stakeholders involved in this and listen to their varying views. The
Conservative Damien Green is the acting chair of the Commons committee that
covers sport, promising not to deploy any football puns, he welcomed the
publication of the government's proposals. But a change in the law would be
needed to implement the measures. So can my right-on-ball friend tell me, is it
the government's intention to legislate in this session and if not is it the
government's intention to legislate in this Parliament to introduce these much-
needed reforms? Stuart Andrew said allocating parliamentary time wasn't in his
gift but a Conservative former minister, Simon Clogg, chipped in with a
suggestion. I would gently point out to the government that we're not
overburdened with legislation on Thursday's for example and I think that is the
scope within the course of the next year to bring forward legislation which
would mean that we can deliver a great outcome for the game that we all love.
But the minister wouldn't be drawn. Labor's Dan Jarvis wondered what the
government's plan, the white paper, would propose regarding club ownership. Over
the years we've seen some owners treat football clubs small like cash cows and
the community assets we all want them to be. So pending the publication of the
white paper later this week I wonder if the minister could say whether he thinks
that there is merit in ensuring that any new owner seeking to take a control in
an English club is subject to a more stringent, fit-and-proper persons test.
Yes. The Lib Dem former leader Tim Farron was worried on two fronts. Many of us
are concerned about the tardiness of this process and the fact they seem to be
listening to the owners more than they're listening to the fans. The minister
said he totally rejected that accusation. Labor's Clive Betts was annoyed by a
suggestion Stuart Andrew had made that football could have got on with reforming
itself. Well the minister just stopped trying to deflect attention away by
saying oh, if only football would sort itself out. The problems we got now, the
minister game is in is because football hasn't sorted itself out and that's why
we need government to come in with a clear statement and a white paper and a
commitment to speedly legislate. Newcastle United are heading to Wembley at the
weekend to face Manchester United in the League Cup final. The MP for Newcastle
Central Labour's Cheon Werer wished her team luck. But he must know that even
that success will not erase the years of anger and frustration at unsuitable,
unaccountable and to my times downright dodgy ownership within a Premier League
which is out of touch and doesn't seem to care about fans. And it was all about
the fans. This government is just messing with the heart and soul of fans. So
will he commit now that the white paper will institute an independent regulator
that fans will have real power in the beautiful game and that this will be in
place for the next, start of the next season. Stuart Andrew said he could assure
her that throughout the process he had listened to the fans and by the way he
would be at the match at Wembley on Sunday and he said he had a list as long as
his arm of people who wanted to go with him. Amanda Baker reporting.
