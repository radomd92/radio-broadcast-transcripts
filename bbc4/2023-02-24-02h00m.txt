 It's 1 o'clock GMT. Hello, I'm Roger Hearing and this is Business Matters on
the BBC World Service. Today we're live in Washington and Delhi. Coming up on
the programme, 365 days of war, reflections on the Ukraine economy after a year
of conflict and what further help the country wants from Western companies.
Don't deal with Russia. Please stop it. Otherwise, you are just on the wrong
side of the history. Please, please, please stop any trading with Russia. Plus
why Canada and the European Union are turning against TikTok. And what exactly
is milk? Oat and soy or cow? We've got the white stuff. That's Business Matters
here on the BBC, coming up after the latest BBC News. I'm Stuart McIntosh with
the BBC News. Hello. As Ukraine marks one year since the start of Russia's full-
scale invasion, the United Nations has overwhelmingly backed a call for Moscow's
forces to pull out immediately. More than 140 countries voted in favour of a
resolution condemning the war. From UN headquarters in New York, here's Neda
Torfik. Nearly three quarters of the world body has consistently supported
Ukraine. The country's foreign minister, Dmitry Kuleba, said he was satisfied
with the vote and the message sent was clear. It doesn't matter what Russia
tries and how it attempts to undermine international order and the coalition in
support of Ukraine's territorial integrity. It fails one time after another.
Only a handful of countries voted against it, including Belarus, North Korea and
Syria. India and South Africa, along with Russia's most powerful ally, China,
were among those that abstained. Poland has begun putting steel and concrete
anti-tank obstacles on its border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The
Polish government says there's been a rise in flights into Kaliningrad from
Turkey and the Middle East. It fears that migrants will be encouraged by Moscow
to cross into the European Union. Adam Easton reports from Warsaw. In November,
the Polish military began laying out a two-and-a-half-metre-high razor-wire
fence along the country's 232-kilometre border with Kaliningrad. Officials said
they were concerned an increase of direct flights into the Russian exclave from
Turkey and the Middle East might herald a new migration crisis. Last year,
Poland completed a five-and-a-half-metre-high steel pole fence on its border
with Belarus, following a huge rise in migrant crossings of people from Asia and
Africa. South Korea has test-fired four strategic cruise missiles into the sea.
The state news agency said the missiles travelled 2,000 kilometres. It added
that the drill demonstrated the readiness of what it called Pyongyang's nuclear
combat force. It's the latest in a series of weapons tests that have increased
tension on the Korean peninsula. A court in Los Angeles has sentenced the former
Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein to a further 16 years in jail for rape and
sexual assault. He's already serving a 23-year sentence after a separate
conviction in New York. Sophie Long reports. Harvey Weinstein sat in court in a
crumpled prison jumpsuit, unable to stand as he was sentenced to a further 16
years in prison. His victim cried as she told the court how his brutal attack
had stripped her of her confidence, ruined her career and left her heartbroken
and alone. She said no sentence could remove the damage, but the maximum term
would restore other victims' faith in the justice system. You're listening to
the latest world news from the BBC. Police in south-east Nigeria have blamed
Biafran separatists for attacks on politicians ahead of the elections on
Saturday. A Labour Party candidate for a Senate seat and two colleagues were
shot dead in Enugu State on Wednesday. An attack on a PDP party convoy killed a
driver. Nigeria faces growing insecurity and frustration at the shortage of cash
following a botched effort to change the country's banknotes. The government of
Madagascar says a powerful storm which battered the east coast of the island is
now known to have killed at least seven people. Cyclone Freddie brought
torrential rain and strong winds tearing roofs off its houses. It's now heading
towards Mozambique, where it's expected to make landfall in the coming hours. A
US federal judge has ordered that the disgraced singer R. Kelly must spend an
extra year in prison on top of a 30-year sentence he's already serving. Kelly
was jailed last year for sex trafficking and racketeering. He was later
convicted in a second trial in Chicago of charges including enticing minors for
sex. Speaking after the sentencing, Kelly's defence lawyer Jennifer Bonejean
said the judge had struck the right balance. The sentence was largely run
concurrent, 19 years, one year added on in real time and that is a win in our
view and it's the right outcome. The judge was reasonable, he I think took into
account both sides and ultimately was fair. Boeing has temporarily suspended
deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner again in order to conduct analysis on a
fuselage component. The Federal Aviation Administration said deliveries would
not resume until it was satisfied the issue had been addressed. The aerospace
giant recommended deliveries recommenced deliveries last August after they'd
been halted for more than a year due to previous problems. That's the BBC News.
Hello and welcome to Business Matters. I'm Roger Hearing. Coming up on the
programme today, it's exactly a year since Russia launched its attempt to remove
Ukraine as a separate nation. But the country has fought its huge neighbour to a
standstill. But at what cost in lives and livelihoods? We're going to hear from
the former and current Ukrainian finance ministers. Also, the European
Commission bans TikTok in its offices as Canada launches a probe into the social
media app over concerns about data use. And oat or soya or even cow, they're all
milk, at least according to the US federal authorities. But should they be? I
absolutely love oat milk. And it like makes me so happy. We'll be talking milk
and I'll be joined throughout the programme by two guests on opposite sides of
the world. Sushma Ramachandran, columnist for the Tribune newspaper and economic
writer, who's joining us from Delhi. And also Natalie Jaresko, who's chairperson
of the Aspen Institute in Kyiv and a former Ukrainian finance minister herself,
who joins us from Washington. Now, we're going to take the whole first half of
the programme to consider what is a very significant moment. Exactly 365 days
ago, the people of Ukraine were enduring a night of horrible expectation
awaiting a Russian invasion they hoped wouldn't come, but which they knew almost
certainly would. And a few hours later, the war began. Reports of explosions in
the Ukrainian capital as Vladimir Putin announces a special military operation
in Ukraine. Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create
threats for our country, our people should know that Russia's response will be
immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced
in your history. It's long been threatened and now it's started. Explosions were
heard in Ukraine's capital Kyiv and here in Kharkiv. Who can stop this war?
People. And these people are amongst you, I am sure. President Putin, and
telling him from the bottom of my heart, stop your troops from an offensive to
Ukraine. Give peace a chance. President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring
your troops back to Russia. The words there of the UN Secretary General, Antonio
Guterres, at the end of that combination of sounds of what was happening 365
days ago. And it has seemed a very, very long war, at least of course for the
people of Ukraine. Let's bring in both my guests to talk about this to begin
with. And let me come to you first, Natalie, because this is your country. It's
a country that you served as Minister of Finance. Looking back now at what's
happened, are you surprised that we are in the position we are where Russia has
not triumphed, despite the extremely high odds initially that it would? No,
thank you, Roger. I'm not surprised that they have not triumphed, and I'm
certain that they will not triumph. I think the surprise lays more in the area
of how incredibly devastating and destructive this war is. I remember when the
war began nine years ago in February of 2014, and this is just so much worse, so
much bigger, so much more devastation, so much more human loss. But no, I'm not
surprised that good will win out over evil and that the Ukrainians will defend
their soil to the last day, to the last drop of blood. You make an important
point, of course. It wasn't the beginning of war. It was the beginning of the
latest stage of war. The war itself has gone on for a long time. And indeed, the
Russians have been carrying it on, often without much external opposition, as we
know. Let me come to you on this, Sushma, because as you probably are aware, in
the last four or five hours, there was a vote at the UN Security Council in
which the UN General Assembly, in fact, overwhelmingly approved a resolution
which called for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine. 141
countries backing that motion. 32 abstentions, seven voting against, 32
abstentions including your country, India. Many people, I guess, certainly in
parts of Europe and the United States and other parts of the world, will be
saying, why would a country like India, a democracy, a country that has defended
its own borders, of course, on many occasions, why would it take this position?
Well, there are a whole lot of complex factors on this. And definitely, I have
to say that there's a lot of general sympathy for the Ukraine people and the
travails that they're going through. It is horrifying. And there's no doubt
about it, that the fact that Russia has invaded the Ukraine is not something
that one can actually support. You cannot support one country invading another
country. But the fact also is, as I said, it's rather complex, that we are,
India has seen Russia as a friend for many decades. And in fact, it has been
kind of for many, at one stage, it was probably the only friend we felt in the
world. And that's a perception that is not just government policy. That's a
perception that has filtered down to the general public. So while, as I said,
there's a great deal of sympathy for the Ukraine, there's also a feeling that
this is the time to be standing behind a friend who was with us in our time of
need. When we had invasions, it was Russia who was standing with us. It wasn't
the West. It was Indira Gandhi trying to fight on our borders. And we had people
like, you know, presidents like Nixon, who were, and of course, his officials
like Kissinger, who were very anti-India. So these kinds of perceptions and the
so-called government policy, the policy of abstention and the policy of trying
to maintain a balance is something that is not just, is something that is
supported by the general public. And you can see that by the media comments on
all these issues. OK, well, it is an interesting position and it's good to get
the explanation because I think a lot of people are perhaps surprised in some
ways. Let's talk, though, about another aspect of all this, which is what's been
happening with the Ukrainian economy, because it is, I suppose, unquestionable
that this amount of conflict and damage have done appalling things to Ukraine,
obviously killed a lot of people, but also deprived a lot of people of their
livelihoods. And Ukraine clearly wants support, more support in weapons, of
course, but also financial support. How much of the support they saw at the UN
General Assembly will actually translate into concrete assistance as the country
struggles to survive? What in fact does the government of Kiev most need in this
area? Is it more sanctions on Russia or more help directly for Ukraine itself
and its finances? Well, Oleg Ustenko is an economic adviser to the president,
Vladimir Zelensky. He says some Western companies are still operating in Russia,
despite promising not to. From the very beginning, when the invasion started,
everybody was saying, I mean, from the civilised world, everybody was saying
that, yes, we do understand. We want to make sure that the blood money are not
sent to Kremlin's regime. However, part of businesses just continue to do
business as usual. I would say that the first message is you guys know this
story. You know that our people are killed. We are paying our lives. So any
extra help you are given to Russian businesses. So please stop it. Please
respect those statements. Otherwise, you are just on the wrong side of the
history. Please, please, please stop any trading with Russia. Oleg Ustenko
there. Natalie, let me bring you in on this, because obviously it's an issue for
Ukraine, the extent to which, well, the West, which has had very, very lengthy
and very strong links economically with Russia, the extent to which it's going
to get rid of them. And I mean, obviously, a lot have gone, but there are
companies as well. Philip Morris, for example, a headline today suggesting that
it was not really able necessarily to pull any further back than it already has.
What's your take on this? I think that companies not only have a moral
responsibility, like Oleg Ustenko was talking about, but they're going to find
that they have legal responsibilities that they need to focus on. You know, the
United Nations guiding principles on businesses in very clearly outlines that
companies that have the ability to step away from contributing to humanitarian
rights being destroyed need to do so. And if not, they can expect that there
will be costs later. And so I think these companies need to start looking at
those UN guidelines and they need to start understanding that by contributing
tax dollars, by Russian law, being forced to provide their employees for
military conscription. When justice does come down, these companies are going to
be asked, could they have left? Could Philip Morris or others have left? Yes,
they could. They could have written off their investment and they could have
walked away rather than contributing to this humanitarian disaster. And so I
think there's going to be a cost. And I think you can see the Ukrainian
government has set up already a list of companies that are contributing to the
terrorism. On that list of companies are those that are refusing, many who are
refusing to walk away, to take the right off, take the loss, but stop
contributing to the war effort. Yeah. So it's a plea, but also I guess a sort of
implied threat in a way. But let me, we're very blessed on this programme
because we have you, former Ukrainian finance minister. We also have actually a
recording of someone who has been speaking to Ukraine's current finance
minister, my colleague Aaron Heselhurst. He's been talking to the current
finance minister, Sergei Marchenko. Let's have a listen. Unfortunately, the
damage done by Russia's aggression for Ukraine is tremendous. Last year we lost
particularly more than 30% of our GDP. There was no country which is comparable
effect, one year effect on the economy. That's why we suffered a lot. We lost
part of our territory, but we're still capable. We're still able and we still
can execute our key function as a government. Starting from the first days of
war, we are able to pay pensions for our people, pay necessary social protection
expenditures as well. We have done all necessary steps to increase our military
budget. Half of our budget is a military budget. And of course, it's not an easy
way to run a country in a war. Your country, Sergei, has had tens of billions of
dollars of international support from the likes of the US and the EU and others
just to keep basics going, such as pension payments, government salaries. Are
you confident that that sort of help is just going to keep coming? We are
confident when we see money in our accounts. If not, we should keep moving, we
should keep negotiation. Of course, now we see that Ukraine is under tremendous
support. All democracies support Ukraine. And it also creates necessary
environment for political support for Ukraine. Despite that, it could be some
fatigue for Ukraine's case. Now we haven't seen fatigue. Much of the support
you've received, particularly from the EU, has been in the form of repayable
loans rather than donations. I mean, I'm just wondering, are you worried that
Ukraine, you're going to be saddled with a mountain of debt that you're just not
going to be able to pay off? We're not worried about that concern right now. Of
course, for us, it's preferable to receive grant financing, but MFA financing,
macro financial assistance from the EU, it's the money which they can provide
for us. And the money which we are attracting from the EU is rather cheap money
because the EU borrows from the risk, as well as money with a long term
maturity. As last year, it was 15 plus. This year is around 30 years for
repayment. How long is it going to take to rebuild Ukraine's economy and get
back to the size it was before the war started? And what gives you hope that it
can be done? Hope it's good, but the real step is better. So I would prefer to
clear vision and clear estimates of what we should do to bring our economy back
to 2021. What we really need is a very cohesion policy within the government,
very wise steps towards necessary policy tools and steps to help our economy to
be in a position before the war. Ukraine's Finance Minister Sergei Marchenko
there speaking to Aaron Heselhurst. Sergei, there's something I wanted to bring
you in on, which is the disruption clearly to Ukraine's economy, but also to the
global economy that's come about as a result of this conflict. Food prices, of
course, food supplies, also energy prices. How has all that affected a country
like India? Well, of course, it was devastating blow right in the beginning.
First of all, oil prices went up to $130 per barrel, and we import over 80% of
our requirement. And it had been estimated that prices would be in the range of
about probably $70 to $75 in 2022. And it's a huge burden on the exchequer. Then
apart from that, there were so many other products that we are importing from
Russia and the Ukraine, like the rest of the world, fertilizers, for instance,
sunflower oil, edible oil prices shot up in the country. And then, of course,
the global supply chain disruptions stopped. You know, the components as well as
metals prices went up. So prices of a whole lot of manufactured products went up
initially. That was, of course, the first few months. And then now, of course,
things have settled down. You know, prices have moderated. But it brought about
the same type of high inflation as occurred around the world. It happened in
India. And the need, obviously, for that all to be sorted through. And as you
say, things are beginning to settle down in some areas. But clearly, there is a
lot more fighting that will be going on in Ukraine. The thing that, you know,
the Central Bank, of course, again, like the rest of the world, started
aggressive rate hikes to curb inflation. And it has, I must say, it has been
probably more successful than many other countries because it's been brought
down to within the tolerance band of about 2 to 6 percent. And many, many
countries around the world have been adjusting in that way. Let me move the
focus, though, also back onto another aspect, of course, of this, which isn't
just the trouble inside Ukraine, but about the fact of people moving from
Ukraine. In fact, eight million or so Ukrainians were forced to flee their
country as a result of the war. Let's hear about what happened to them, because
the BBC's James Graham has been looking at some and talking to some of the many
Ukrainian business people who were forced out of their country by the war and
who are now starting from scratch elsewhere in the world. Every news bulletin
carried the same pictures, crowds of people carrying all they could fleeing war.
But what happened after those first weeks of turmoil? Anastasia and her partner
Alexei settled in northern England and started a cleaning business. But it's
been challenging. We don't have a lot of customers. We don't have a lot of
orders. But we need to start with small things and step by step, maybe, maybe
this year we will get more orders. This wasn't her chosen career, and it hasn't
been simple picking up where she left off. I was a lawyer. Then when I moved to
England, I tried to be a lawyer maybe here, but I understand that it's
different. In the future I need to make my qualification or I need to get my
degree. So I want to try, I want to continue. Maybe I'll open my small law
company in UK and will help Ukrainian. Julia also came to the UK, a seamstress
by trade. She tried to restart her wedding dress business. My husband sent me
sewing machines and everything, but it's not easy because system of business in
England is different. It's not like in Ukraine. And I start work in the wedding
dress factory. And I'm happy with this job. She says worries over language and
the different legal system held her back. I really scared that I'll do something
wrong and then I can have a problem here. So I just think, okay, I just take
this choice and work with company and this will be more easy for me because I
think I need more time, not like one year. So while some seek to build new
businesses, others have kept things going back in Ukraine from afar. Konstantin,
an IT entrepreneur, was caught outside the country at the time of the invasion.
Fortunately, he had a plan for his staff. Before the war, we said that everyone
has $2,000 for relocation. And we either compensate them afterwards or we give
them beforehand as cash. So they just have this money set aside in case if
something happens. When it began, the entire team was 40% functional the first
week. And in a month, they were back at 100%. Konstantin says those wages,
together with his ongoing campaign to encourage people to buy from Ukraine,
helps everyday livelihoods for the millions who remain. James Graham reporting
there on the impact of people who have left Ukraine, had to leave Ukraine. And
Natalie, let me bring you in on this because that is a problem in itself, a kind
of brain drain, a drain of talent out of a country for obvious reasons, but with
big implications for Ukraine's future. Enormous implications. It's the labour
force of the future. And that's another reason why this war cannot go on forever
and ever. The longer people are away, the more they settle down and grow roots
into those communities. And we want everyone to come home. And so one of the
questions is, why the question is always weapons, weapons, weapons, it's to end
the war as soon as possible, and then to begin reconstruction, reconstruction
first and foremost of infrastructure, of communities where these people can come
home. They want schools for their children and they want jobs. So getting the
economy back, as the minister described, to full speed is extremely important,
not just for those who remain, but specifically for the 8 million that have been
forced to leave. But they can only come, they will only come back if it's safe
to do so. I mean, what's your situation? I mean, you clearly are from Ukraine. I
know you have very strong roots also in the US, but you're not in Ukraine at the
moment. Is that partly a safety decision on your part? No, I've been abroad,
unfortunately, working for the last six years. So I just haven't been there for
the last few years. Would you think of going back at the moment, or would you be
concerned for your safety if you did? If I had a purpose there and I had a role
that I could play that was of value to the country, I would. Right now, that
role and the value I can create is more outside of the country than it is
inside. So yes, I'll go back. Well, good. I mean, I can imagine that you're
exactly the sort of person who would be able to help there, of course. Sushma,
let me come to you on this. I mean, it is a grim thing for a country when it
loses that many of its population, particularly its working, inspirational,
entrepreneur part of the population. Yes, yes, of course it is. And that has,
the migration at the time, initially, was something that was covered, as I said,
in a very detailed way on our media. And we had people going in, we had
reporters going into the Ukraine and reporting. So as I said, there's a lot of
sympathy for what Ukraine has gone through. At that time, of course, there was a
huge operation from India to get, evacuate the medical students. We had
thousands of medical students located in the Ukraine. And getting them out was a
problem. The Ukraine authorities were, of course, as helpful as they could be,
but it was wartime. And Russia was also helpful. Again, once again, you know,
come back to the fact that Indians view Russians as, you know, they're safe. You
know, people were saying if they can go to the eastern border, then the Russians
can pick them up. So there's a feeling that Russia is a longstanding friend, and
they will always be good to Indians. And this operation, I'm sorry to say that
during the operation, there were a lot of allegations that there were racist
attitudes toward the medical students. Which may or may not have been correct.
May not be true. Unfortunately, we can't get into it right now. We're going to
have to move on from this. But thanks to both of you. In the next part of the
programme, we look at some other issues, most particularly TikTok and how that
is a problem potentially for data in the European Union. Come back in a moment.
This is Business Matters. This is the BBC World Service with the winner of the
English as a Second Language prize for the International Radio Playwriting
Competition. My name is Aynur Karim. I am a writer from Kazakhstan and my play.
It's a funny story about a student who finds someone else's passport and wants
to give it back to its owner. I thought I'd better take it to the police station
myself. It's on my way. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Show me the passport. At
first, I felt a little bit like I was limited in the way how I can express
myself. But then I like it even more because you close your eyes and you just
need to imagine. Ruslan Agdarov, not a Kazakh? Why isn't the nationality stated
in the passport? Why do you say he's not a Kazakh? He is a Kazakh, absolutely. I
would be happy if people just laugh and enjoy it. The man lost his passport. He
must give it back. What a face. The Passport, Saturday at 19 and Sunday at 12
GMT. You're listening to Business Matters from the BBC World Service with me,
Roger Hearing. Coming up in the next half hour, we're live in Asia with a
roundup of news and business headlines from across the world. And comment from
our guests, Natalie Jaresko and Sushma Ramachandran. We're going to be looking
at the growing pushback against TikTok and asking with soy, oat and almond on
offer as well as cow, when is milk not milk? All coming up after the news. BBC
News with Neil Nunes. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed a vote
at the United Nations calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of
Russian troops. The resolution was backed by an overwhelming majority of
countries, which Mr. Zelensky described as a powerful signal of global support.
Friday marks exactly a year since the full-scale invasion began. Poland is
fortifying its border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The Polish
government fears that migrants from Turkey and the Middle East are being
encouraged to travel to the area where they could cross into the European Union.
North Korea has launched four cruise missiles into the sea. It's the latest in a
series of provocative weapons tests. A court in Los Angeles has sentenced the
former Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein to 16 more years in prison. The
rape and sexual assault charges date back to 2013. He's already serving a long
sentence for another conviction. Madagascar's government says a powerful storm
which battered the island's east coast has killed at least seven people. Cyclone
Freddie is now heading for Mozambique. Peru's government has declared a state of
emergency in more than a dozen areas because of an outbreak of dengue fever.
It's recorded more than 11,000 cases of the disease this year. Boeing has
temporarily suspended deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner to conduct analysis on a
fuselage component. The company restarted deliveries of the jet last August
after they had been halted for more than a year because of other problems. The
Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter
over a fatal shooting on a film set. The actor was holding a gun that went off
while making the movie Rust, killing the cinematographer Helena Hutchins. BBC
World News. Welcome back to Business Matters with me Roger Hearing and my guests
today, Natalie Jaresko and Sushma Ramachandran. Now TikTok is the must-have
social media app for anyone under 30. The Chinese-owned platform is practically
everywhere. But it's not going to be inside the offices of the European
Commission anymore. The European Commission has told staff to remove TikTok from
their phones and any devices running EU programs. At the same time, the Canadian
government has launched a joint federal and provincial investigation into TikTok
over concerns about the use of private information. Well, I've been speaking
about all this to Shiona McCallum, who's the BBC's technology reporter. I asked
her what the European Commission had done exactly and why. Yes, so the European
Commission earlier said that cyber security was the main crux of this and that
they had questions over what TikTok might be doing with their data. Now, of
course, TikTok is owned by ByteDance and that's the parent company founded in
China. And critics have been raising these fears that data could be passed to
the Chinese state, to Beijing. And, you know, the concern is, Roger, if you've
got TikTok on your phone, is it reading your emails? Is it looking at your
photos? Is it accessing your contacts? And ultimately, is it making that
information available to the Chinese government? And that's the concern. So the
EC have really only come out and said this is a cyber security issue. But we
know that that's the context around this concern over China. And of course, it's
not just the Europeans. We know, I think, the US government, federal
institutions have been looking at this as well. And now the Canadians have put
in position some kind of inquiry as well. Yeah, that's right. You mentioned
those two. Last month, the Dutch government advised public officials to stay
clear of it. You know, famously, India has completely banned TikTok a couple of
years ago for the geopolitical concerns. And so it's interesting to now see
various pockets of the government and institutions coming out and telling their
staff that, you know, they shouldn't be downloading this app because of these
worries. Here in the UK, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee,
Alicia Cairns, urged people to delete the app as well. So these murmurings are
kind of having this effect, I think, globally. And I think it will be
interesting to see what other countries and departments kind of maybe follow
suit. But two questions arise, Shona. One is, didn't we kind of know this
beforehand? And also, really, with young people particularly being so keen on
it, it's not going to make much difference. Right. I mean, I don't know how much
of an effect this will have on TikTokers. Remember, TikTok's available in over
150 countries, been downloaded over three and a half billion times. It's the
fastest growing social media platform in the world. And look, if we're all
continually giving away our data all the time, you know, we're on social media
platforms. If we fill in a form online or, you know, we have other health apps,
for example, on our phone, we're continually giving the data away. So is TikTok
any different from Facebook or Instagram? I suspect people won't feel
differently or sit up and listen, you know, any more in this scenario during
this case. But it will be interesting to see if we get more of this movement
almost from the top, and then maybe that will trickle through eventually. And I
suppose the point is, yes, we give away our data, but this is to China. Maybe
that really is the difference. People are concerned that China seems, if not to
be an adversary, at least a questionable presence on the international board.
Yeah, that's correct. And, you know, the Chinese and surveillance has been a
concern, you know, not just on social media companies, but also big tech
companies. We've had the issues with Huawei in the past. And so people are a bit
more sceptical about what the Chinese may do with the data. And I think that's
just that unknown quantity, really. Of course, TikTok have responded to today's
news. They said they're disappointed with the European Commission's decision.
They believe it's misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions. And what
they also said was that they're trying to establish data centres in Europe to
store data locally. So they're kind of ensuring users, certainly within the EU,
that that data will not be going to China. But, you know, we actually don't
really know where the data goes when it comes to TikTok. And that was Shona
McCallum, BBC's technology reporter. Now, as she said, of course, it's banned
already in India, but Natalie, it's not clearly banned in the US, at least not
widely so. Do you have TikTok? No, never use it and urged my daughters from day
one never to use it as well. And did they respond? They claim that they don't
have it. Yes, I think adults. So quite that's that's an issue, isn't it? But
Sushma, I mean, it is banned in India. Is there any way round? People, I
imagine, can get round things on terms of virtual personal networks and stuff.
But is there much of that or is it just literally not there at all? No, it's not
there. It's not there at all. And the thing is, it's it's you know, there are
other apps which allow you to have these short reels. So, you know, I think
probably Instagram has been the biggest beneficiary. Yeah. So, you know,
Instagram has sort of grown very rapidly as far as these short reels are
concerned. Yeah. And of course, you do get a lot of TikTok videos coming from
other countries. That's a different matter. But apparently India was the biggest
market outside China when it banned. It's interesting. In 2020. Yeah. 200
million users were there in India. Yeah. Well, it taps into, I think, a
particular sort of outlook that a lot of younger people do have in terms of what
they want. And Natalie, we come to you on that because clearly the issue is here
concern about what data is going to China, what what is being put back there.
And that's that's on a lot of areas Huawei and all sorts of things, but
particularly it seems on TikTok, because young people, it seems, are willing to
give almost anything away in terms of TikTok. And do you see that as a major
problem? You clearly didn't want your daughters using it. I did. I do see it as
a major problem. And I do urge people to educate in schools, universities and at
home, our children to figure out, you know, that they should not be providing
that kind of information, that they should be protecting their privacy. It
doesn't mean that they can't enjoy social media, but there is a limit. And I
think that so far what's happened both in the EU and the federal government, the
United States has to do with government and cybersecurity for government
secrets. But this is this potentially goes much further. And we need to urge our
children to start thinking about this. Yeah, and it's the same for Instagram and
Facebook and all manner of other platforms. I mean, TikTok isn't worse in that
sense, as you say, apart from, you know, state secrets, but in general terms, it
isn't. It's not worse, but China doesn't allow Western social media into China.
It blocks Gmail, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram. So there's no reason to
believe that they don't take the same measures with regard to our social media.
So Sushma, when TikTok was banned in India, did a lot of, I mean, Instagram,
Facebook, the others, did they all jump on that and are now even more popular as
a result? Do young people go for those rather than anything else? Yes, yes, yes,
absolutely. There was, of course. But, you know, the thing is, it happened after
India had a clash with China on the border. And there was a lot of, there is
even now a lot of suspicion of China. So the government's decision was actually
hailed in the country that, you know, this is something positive. We should be
doing things like that. We should be banning these kind of things. The fact is
that we have a lot of trade relations, bilateral trade relations with China. I
think there are about 700 to 800 Chinese companies which are based in India. So
there is a fear that there are security breaches as far as some of the companies
like the telecom company, Huawei is not allowed to bid for certain telecom
contracts. So TikTok, the ban, you know, was accepted and, you know, young
people just moved on to other apps. I mean, they can, there's so much available.
But not interestingly, Sushma, I mean, China obviously, ByteDance, a Chinese
company, produces TikTok. But there are other Indian homegrown social media apps
as well. I mean, does this exist? Yes, they are. They are. But the fact is that
the, I have to say, the ones which, you know, the Western ones are far more
popular as far as, you know, as I said, Instagram and Snapchat and all these
other things. I mean, I don't even know how many there are. There are lots and
lots out there. And I doubt, sorry, coming back to what Natalie said about
advising her daughter, you know, I doubt I've ever advised my children on this
kind of a thing. And I somehow wonder, I don't think children really listen, you
could tell them, but I think my children think they know far more about the
internet than I do. Well and certainly my children certainly do. I mean,
Natalie, how did you feel about that? My girls are concerned about their
privacy. So we've lived in a former communist country for many years. Exactly.
And on that point, Natalie, I did want to bring up in relation to what we were
talking about earlier, because one thing that has been very clear from the last
year has been how much information has come out on social media from the war. I
mean, videos of fighting, frontline fighting, but also people who are leaving
the country. I mean, it's been an important, we may have suspicions about it,
but it has, and even including TikTok, has been a very important source of
information, hasn't it? No question. The ability to have a telephone in every
place in the world now, and to shoot live video and to take testimonials from
everyone, means that we're all seeing it live 24 hours a day, but it also allows
people to create false narratives, false propaganda. And so I think one of the
challenges we have with all of this information coming to us from social media
is how to determine what's true and what's not. And in the Ukraine context, that
has been a huge challenge because it is a situation where bad actors, if you
like, wanting to influence the outcome and the way people see it, get in there.
Does Ukraine have adequate means to try and deal with that? Well, they've been
extremely successful. When I was minister, we had one of the first major cyber
attacks against our electricity system, and it went down and it was a major
crisis. And now there are thousands and thousands of cyber attacks daily by the
Russians on every system. And yet the banking system is holding up and
functioning quite well. It hasn't been brought down. The government systems have
not been brought down. They've been able to, as the minister said earlier,
deliver all government services. So the Ukrainian technology future is very,
very bright. It's shown itself to be adaptable, it's current, it's functional
and it's the leading advantage, the leading edge right now in the Ukrainian
economy. Yeah, I think I've certainly been impressed by the amount that has come
from semi-official sources, if you like, but on social media, on Twitter, TikTok
as well, but also Instagram. The Ukrainians have kind of harnessed this for
their own purposes. In a way, I think somehow, perhaps the Russians haven't. Is
that your impression? Absolutely. I was at a museum the other day that had the
ocular vision goggles. You could actually step into the ruins of any of five
different cities in Ukraine and you were physically present in 3D in these
cities on the streets. What they've been able to do is amazing. And Sushma, I
mean, this is a way, I mean, we talked about how it's used for social comments
and all kinds of things, but increasingly in India too, I mean, it is a vehicle
for giving people insights into things they might not otherwise see. I mean,
sometimes it can work badly. We know there have been killings that have come off
the back of social media suggestions about things, but do you feel it's been a
socially positive development for India as well? Oh yes, of course, because you
know, so many people who are sort of, let's say, outside of the normal ambit of
India come into it. I mean, even in rural areas, people have phones and they can
connect. And we talk about TikTok, but there are things, there are apps which
allow farmers to find out about weather, about meteorology, about fertilizer and
the use of fertilizer and the use of pesticides and when to sow their crops. All
this kind of information is coming through the telephone, through apps, special
apps. And so it's a great boon, I must say. And of course, India has more or
less completely stopped laying landlines of phones in rural areas because you
can just give the mobile phone. So it's been a great leap of technology and
social media has contributed to it, no doubt. Yeah, and in a way, coming back to
you, Natalia, maybe when in the rebuilding of Ukraine, maybe that's something
that will happen, a recognition that, you know, perhaps some of the old
technology no longer needs to be rebuilt. There are new things that would work
better. Absolutely. I mean, it's already happened in the banking system. The
fintech sector in Ukraine is far leaps and bounds ahead of the United States or
Europe. The ability of the government to stay in touch with its citizens through
a mobile app called DIA, where they're able to both provide for documentation
through the mobile app and or subsidies to the internally displaced people
throughout the country. It's an extraordinary application that was homegrown,
built in Ukraine and now, you know, is being used as an example to be rebuilt in
other European countries. And so I think, you know, Ukraine is leapfrogging on
technology. Some very few, but good things that can be said to have come out of
the last year and longer reflection on what's been going on in Ukraine. Let's
turn to something very different now. Perhaps a rather nicer thought. A nice
glass of milk. Now, doesn't that sound like something that we'd all quite like
to have? But what do you think of when I say the word milk? Is it something that
we get from cows or sheep or camels, I suppose, or even buffalo? Is it
something, however, made perhaps from oats or soy or cashew or coconut or hemp
or even quinoa? I tend to veer away from dairy where possible due to farting
cows. We're not baby cows. We shouldn't be drinking milk if we're not, if it
wasn't made for us, I suppose. I absolutely love oat milk. Really? And it like,
makes me so happy. I like them, but they didn't, to me, they weren't quite the
full replacement of the milk experience that I would have looked or hoped for. I
think it probably boils down to habit and the idea that it's got calcium in it.
I don't mind any of them. Sorry, is that annoying? Yes, it is rather. Those are
some views from here in the UK, of course, reflecting some rather varied ideas
about including environmental issues, I suppose, when it comes to milk. Even
mentioned there of bovine flatulence, just what you want. Well, up to now in the
US, it's been a matter of dispute what can call itself milk, with the dairy
industry maintaining milk should come from animals or it ain't milk. But the
Food and Drug Administration there has now made a judgment that plant-based
beverages can call themselves milk because they don't pretend to be from dairy
animals. And US consumers apparently aren't confused by the difference. Well,
the rules also call for voluntary extra nutrition labels that note when the
drinks have lower levels of nutrients than dairy milk, calcium, magnesium or
vitamin D. But essentially, the veggie milk has won. Well, joining me now to get
a sense of what this means is Indra Oye, who's a food science professor at New
Zealand's University of Otago. Professor Oye, thanks so much for being with us.
Does this actually matter? I mean, we know what milk is. We don't really care if
it comes from vegetable sources or animal sources. It's just there and we like
it. Yeah, I think this discussion is quite interesting because normally we call
milk if it is coming from the animal. Basically, the liquid is, I mean, secreted
from the mammary glands of mammalian. So with the wording of milk, people have
already used it quite a different way now with the consumer. The consumer
recognizes almost all of the liquid with the white color or milky color. They
call it milk. However, if you reflect back, we have already used quite a lot of
plant milk in the past, for example, like soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk,
rice milk. And I think this is the way how consumer knows. However, this is with
the new FDA proposal that it is given yesterday. There are risks and also
benefits around this. But the risks can be misleading for the consumer. But
however, this discussion is quite interesting because now the food producer has
to put the label around nutrition information. Right. So they need to actually
say they need to actually say in a clearer way what exactly it is that you're
having. Exactly. And I think it is open the choice to the consumer to know
better about what they eat and drink. Currently, I think the problem with the
wording of milk is really misleading. However, when you have a labeling, it is
something the wording that consumer need also to understand. So that is also
kind of a risk, but also the benefits when we talk about a product, for example,
like soy milk. They know what we are talking about. But when we say when we say
milk, Professor, we think, I suppose, of one particular thing mainly, which is
still animal origin. But is it does it actually make it is it a different thing?
I mean, we would we get the same nutrients? Do we get the same benefits from
drinking of soy milk or oat milk as we would from drinking cow's milk? No,
totally not, because the amount of protein that is provided by cornmeal with the
quality that they deliver coming from animal milk compared to plant milk is
different. And it is the consumer need to know about that. For example, like the
amino acid compositions, they are different. And also the bioethanol and also
the other mineral and vitamins is normally naturally present in the corn milk we
have to fortify in the plant milk. So basically, consumer need to know those
actually information in the ingredient list. Yeah. And I mean, the other point,
obviously, in all this, the reason that oat milk and the others have become
popular in part is a feeling that using cows, lots and lots of cows to produce
milk actually is not great for the environment. So, I mean, there is a positive
side to this as well. Exactly. And I think the discussion about the plant milk
here, it is coming now after the propaganda and advertisement for the plant milk
has been cheated due to the climate change, the environment matter, you know,
and that is important for us now to line up the discussions with the consumer.
Hey, that is the product that normally you know about the soy milk. However, it
is the benefits around that milk. If you have an allergy towards corn milk and
you have no other choice or you have a problem with, you know, some digestion
because sometimes people do not have any enzyme that can digest, but it is an
option or alternative. So, in this case, it is quite important that we
communicate well with the consumer. Yeah, it is always the case, really, I
think. Professor Oi, thanks so much for being with us. That is Indra Oi, food
science professor at New Zealand's University of Otago. Right. Now, we have some
milk with us, I think. Well, I do. And I think from the warnings I have received
that, Sushma, you have something there, buffalo milk. Is that right? Yes. You
know, India has a huge population of water buffaloes and it is used as milk
cattle, especially in the northern part of the country. So about roughly half of
our total milk production comes from these water buffaloes, which are used as
milk cattle. And I have got a glass of this. Is it nice? I mean, would you ever,
for example, that milk? I mean, tell us how it differs from cow's milk when you
just drink it now. Just tell us the different taste. Well, I don't think the
taste is much different at all. I mean, I don't think the taste is different at
all, because of course, what you do get from the company that we get it from,
which is the government-owned mother dairy, it's called in northern India, that
will give you the milk with different levels of fat. Right. So buffalo milk
traditionally has a higher level of fat, but you can get skim milk and you can
get, you know, milk with lower fat. So you have the other varieties of it. Okay.
Okay. Now you can also get cow milk. You can opt for cow milk. You don't have to
have this. No, no, indeed. Well, I mean, India is the country of the cow in many
ways. So that's entirely reasonable. Now, Natalie, it may come to you because
milk, I don't know what milk you've managed to get, if anything, with you there.
But cow's milk obviously is a big thing in Ukraine. I mean, you have, you know,
you have herds of cows as well as your grain field. So it's a big, it's a big
producer in many ways, isn't it? It is indeed. And I could drink if only had
cow's milk all my life. It kind of tells you my age and my culture. I've had
coconut milk in Thai food. So, you know, I've tried coconut milk, but I've never
purchased or tried soy or any... Have you got any milk there with you now at
all? I do, but it's cow milk. Right. Okay. Well, listen, I want all of us...
Now, Sushma, I want you to pour out a little bit of your buffalo milk and then
drink it. And I'm going to pour out, I don't know if anyone hear this, I've
actually got some soy milk here. Now I'm just going to pour it out. I don't know
if you can hear that. Do you want to drink it? Well, yes, I want to try it. I
want to see now. I don't normally drink milk, but I'll have it for your sake,
Roger. Please. Well, it's for business matters and it matters. And Natalie, take
a little bit of yours. Now, I just want to compare tastes. Now I'm going to
slurp my soy milk here. Ready? Oh, sorry. That is horrible. That is vile. Oh,
no. Well, now I'm not going to try it. Oh, dear. No, that's not me. No, sorry. I
mean, I'm sure it's lovely. I'm sure it's healthy, but it's just not me. It's
not milk. I've got some proper milk here from the BBC fridge, I'll have you
know. But first of all, I want Sushma, I want you to take a slurp of your
buffalo milk. Yes, I've had it. I've had it. Can you describe, is it just
ordinary milk? Or it has a little bit of a different flavor? I mean, what's your
sense of it? Well, it's ordinary milk for me, because I've been having this all
my life. And so for me, this is the normal milk taste. And yet, of course, we
have cow milk also. Yeah, yeah, as you say. And it tastes just the same. There's
no difference. But you have a lot of yogurt as well, don't you? Because I think
I'm right in saying some Indians are not able to easily digest ordinary milk and
yogurt's easier. I cannot. I cannot digest milk. I mean, I was having it till a
few decades ago, but then I stopped having milk. And I come from a part of the
country, the Punjab, where milk is virtually, milk and milk products are
virtually sacred, because, you know, you must have huge quantities of milk and
butter and curd and ghee, you know, I mean, it's a huge part of your diet. Oh,
absolutely. Absolutely. But yes, I cannot digest it. So we have, my husband and
I have a lot of yogurt. I mean, every meal we have at least one bowl of yogurt.
And of course, ghee we have in smaller quantities. Indeed. Let me come back to
Natalie. Natalie, your milk you've got is the sort of milk you get in Washington
easily enough. It's just ordinary cow's milk. Is that right? It is, indeed. Does
it taste any different to the milk you used to have in Ukraine? Yes, it does,
because this is pasteurized. And in Ukraine, more often than not, we were
drinking UHT milk, the ones that come in the boxes that stand for a longer time.
So it does have a different taste, you have to get used to it. But it's, you
know, creamy and rich. Yes, it's nice. It's good. And how does it, have you ever
tried any of the oat milks or almond milks or any of these other? I have not.
Other than coconut milk and Thai food, I have not tried any. And is that because
you just don't fancy, I mean, you know, I just demonstrated that I'm not really
my cup of tea, but I mean, I wouldn't even have it. I don't even like the 2%
that looks like colored water. So I like creamy whole milk, or I don't drink it
at all. I don't drink water if I'm going to drink water. Right, right. And
Sushma, you wouldn't want to try oat milk or almond milk or anything, would you?
No, I, yeah, no, I have. I went through a phase where I decided to stop dairy
products just for three, four months. But then I started having soya milk in my
coffee when I would go out of the house. And was that good? It was very nice.
But I didn't have it plain. I had it, I mean, it was part of a coffee. So you
didn't really notice it that much, that it was different then, really? No, not
really. OK. Well, in this, in this wonderfully scientific test we've all been
doing, I have to say, soya milk has not come out well. I'm just actually having
a nice glass of BBC. Hang on. Oh, that's a lot better. Yes, no, I think, I think
certainly I'm not a convert and I don't think Sushma will be. And I'm pretty
sure Natalie won't be. I think we've demonstrated that as far as we're
concerned, milk is one thing and, well, all the others can have what they want
in the name of almond and other milks. But yeah, there we are. Scientific test
on business matters. Anyway, thanks to Natalie. Thanks to Sushma. I hope you
enjoy whatever I forced you to drink. And we're back same time tomorrow with
more business matters. That's business matters for today. Bye bye. This is the
