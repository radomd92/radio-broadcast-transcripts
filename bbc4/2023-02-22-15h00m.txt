 Just say Open BBC Sounds to get started. BBC News at 2 o'clock. Shamima Begum,
who left the UK as a teenager to join the Islamic State group, has lost a legal
challenge to the government's decision to take her British citizenship away. She
was 15 when she travelled to Syria in 2015. The government maintains that Ms
Begum, who's now 23 and living in a Syrian refugee camp, could still present a
security risk. But her lawyers argue she was a child victim of human
trafficking. Gareth Pearce, one of her legal team, said they would be
challenging the decision in the public interest. The implication, the outcome
that we face is that no British child who has been trafficked outside the UK
will be protected by the British state if the Home Secretary invokes national
security. The National Secretary of the GMB union, Andy Prendergast, has accused
the government of trying to do a tawdry backroom deal to resolve strike action
in the NHS. Talks between the Health Secretary Steve Barclay and the Royal
College of Nursing are taking place this afternoon. Mr Prendergast says his
union, which represents thousands of nurses and ambulance workers, should have
been included. In the past few minutes, it's been announced that ambulance and
other health workers in unison will strike on March 8th. British Steel has
confirmed it intends to close its coking ovens in Scunthorpe with the loss of
260 jobs. The company's Chinese owners are blaming high inflation and energy
costs. Unions say the plan is devastating. Official figures show that people
from ethnic minorities no longer have a higher Covid death rate than white
people. The statistics tracked mortality rates from January to November last
year. And the Queen Consort pulled out of a charity visit scheduled for this
morning, a week after contracting Covid. Buckingham Palace says she's making
excellent progress but needs more time for a full recovery. BBC News. In 15
minutes on Radio 4 we'll have the concluding part of the latest series of Faith,
Hope and Glory, Carol Russell's epic drama series charting the emergence of
modern multicultural Britain. But first it's the archers and Kirsty is in hiding
from her next door neighbour. Guess who I just bumped into when I got home?
You're home already? Yes, to get on with the decorating, remember? Oh yes, yes,
sorry, yes, I remember. So guess who was waiting outside the house with a frozen
shepherd's pie? Brian? Yep, Brian. He wanted to say thank you for us having him
over the other night. Oh, well that's nice. No, no that's not nice, Roy. Oh,
yeah, it's not, you're right. Because now he's gone to throw on some overalls
and help me with painting Phoebe's old room. He'll be back any minute. I take it
you don't want that? No, I don't. I just wanted a little peace with my
paintbrush. When are you getting home? Oh, well, we got the architect over this
weekend but I don't think I can get away for another couple of hours at least.
So looking forward to some time to just chill out and paint without having to
tiptoe around Brian. Come on, Kirsty, have some sympathy. I have, on several
occasions. You may as well have an adjoining door so he doesn't have to bother
ringing the bell. I'm sorry, but... No, Roy, you need to get home as soon as
possible and help. Well, help how? I don't know, but he's your daughter's
grandad. What's that got to do with anything? Just get back as soon as you can.
Brian, come in. Right, where do you want me? What on earth did you say that for?
Because I don't want to be the one who stands between him and his daughters. I
thought Tom was going to finish off planting the broad beans. Don't change the
subject. Suggesting he go with them sounds like you want him to go. I do, if
that's what he wants. You're making no sense. Dad, Lee is a very experienced
physiotherapist. If he can get a green card, he'd find work out there quite
easily. I can't pretend his only choice in life is to watch his children get on
a plane and move to the other side of the world. But suggesting he go with them
and set up a life in America... I've turned this over and over in my head, Dad.
I see how much he's hurting. And it is a valid and real option. The only thing
stopping him is us, him and me. It'd be selfish to try and keep him here. So
what if he decides to do it? I don't know. If Lee chooses to move to California,
what happens to you and the boys? Would you go with him? I don't see how that's
possible. The boys' schooling and my work here... So if he goes, that's it for
you two? Dad, I wish it were simpler. I wish Mabel and Evie loved it here and
didn't want to go abroad, but they really do. Lee's cut up about it. If he needs
to be with his children, who am I to stand in his way? I love him too much for
that. Besides, we'd still be here, living our lives, but his side of things
would be pretend. That's a very noble approach, Helen, but it's a risky one too.
One that could cost you your happiness. Well, right now it is Lee's happiness
I'm thinking about. Although he's been so quiet since last night, I'm not even
sure he's speaking to me. Oh, well, that'll make judging the pancake competition
fun. Yeah. Have you had a chance to speak to Lillian yet? One problem at a time,
Helen. He's asleep in the armchair? Yes. How long? Just over an hour. Can't he
sleep at his own house in his own chair? Apparently not. He started off well,
really tried to help, but you can't really distinguish between the old paint and
the new. The colours are too similar. At least he tried. So I convinced him to
come down for a break, and one cup of tea and two digestives later, he's gone.
Maybe you should wake him. Me? Yes. Oh, I was really looking forward to some
telly in me feet up after the day I've had. Join the club. I was meant to be
soaking in the bath around about now, but how can I with Brian in the living
room? We could just go out to the pub, leave him a note in case he wakes up. How
does that help? I don't know. Wouldn't it be too horrible for him to wake up
with no one here? Maybe he won't wake up and he'll still be asleep when we get
back. Either way, I'm starving. Well, look, I know it's my turn, but I haven't
had a chance to cook. I thought you said he brought a shepherd's pie. Oh, yeah.
I'll go and put it in the oven. Tony? Lee. You come to collect me for the
pancake competition. In fact, shouldn't you be over there flipping pancakes
already? Natasha and Pat are there with Helen. They seem to be doing okay
without me. You were all guggo yesterday. Yesterday seems a long time ago.
Listen, Lee, is this about the girls being excited about San Francisco? They
confided in you too? No, Helen did. Right. Only because she was trying to get
her thoughts in order. Did she tell you she suggested I move to California with
them? Yes. Wow. So she's really been thinking about it. She's obviously looking
for a way out. Nonsense. She's literally asking me to leave, Tony. Oh, maybe I
shouldn't be discussing this with you, but... She's reminding you there is an
option where you get to be closer to them. No matter what it costs Helen and the
boys. So she's willing to let me go? I'm not sure willing is the right word.
She's been in knots about this. She seemed pretty calm and clear last night.
It's not an easy situation for either of you, but each day she sees you enjoying
being a father with Mabel and Evie, she's acutely aware of what you'll be
missing when they go. I asked her, what about us? She didn't say anything. It's
not her decision to make, it's yours. I know my daughter, Lee. She doesn't want
this to be more difficult for you than it has to be. Sooner or later, the girls
will be getting on a plane and it seems you have a decision to make. It'll be
alright if it was just one decision. I thought this was about me and the girls,
not me and Helen as well. Maybe I'm just not good at judging this kind of thing.
I don't think that's it. Then why would she tell me going was an option? Because
if she faced the same situation with Jack and Henry, what would you tell her?
Stay and let your boys go? What she said took every bit of love and strength she
has in her, Lee. She suggested it because she loves you and she knows how much
you love your girls. What am I supposed to do, Tony? I don't envy your
situation, but I will say this. Being a good parent isn't just about being in
the same house or the same country as your children. Of course it's the ideal,
but when it's not possible, that's not the end. There are a dozen ways you can
be present in each other's lives in a meaningful and real way, even long
distance. I keep worrying they'll think I don't love them. Mabel and Evie are
old enough to know you love them, Lee. I see it whenever you're together. Yeah?
Yes. And you have this knack of making all four children feel loved without ever
feeling like they're competing for first place. Why do you think they all get
along so well? That is true parenting in my book. I'm awfully sorry. I don't
know what it is about this chair and that narrator's voice. It puts me right to
sleep. Don't worry, Brian. Happens to the best of us. You're probably more tired
than you think you are. Maybe an early night would do you good. Yes, yeah. Well,
I'd better be off. Oh, and don't forget the shepherd's pie. It's already in the
oven. Oh, good. Give yourselves a night off cooking. Thanks. Why don't you stay?
What? It's a massive shepherd's pie. It's too big for two. I know. Joy's food
parcels are very generously portioned. Yeah, listen, thank you, but I couldn't
possibly impose after the embarrassment of dropping off. Oh, well. And you've
got something for your dinner, have you? Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry about me.
Well, there's no point in defrosting another dish when there's plenty to go
round. Really? Well, if you're both sure. Of course. Well, I might go and get
changed. If that's OK. Maybe we could crack open a decent bottle of wine from
next door. Oh, sounds great. I'll bring some over. Well, it'll be ready by the
time you get back. Excellent. I'll see you both in a moment. Yeah. Ow! What's
got into you? He was ready to leave. Oh, come on. He did bring the pie over. His
freezer's stocked full of them. I'm only trying to find the silver lining. There
isn't one, Roy. Our house has been taken over. Quality wine is a luxury. I'm not
going to be able to afford it. I'm not going to be able to afford it. I'm not
going to be able to afford it. I'm not going to be able to afford it. Our house
has been taken over. Quality wine and good home cooking isn't a silver lining.
It's not that I don't feel awful for him. And my heart goes out to him. It
really does. But... Say it. Brian's company isn't exactly... He always asks
about work. And before I know it, he's going on about ways to develop the
rewilding site that are diametrically opposite to my basic world view. He means
well. I know. I'm ashamed of myself for saying this, but once he's had a couple
of drinks, he doesn't know when to stop. And I'm so tired of having to smile
politely and wait for him to wind down. I don't know what's worse, when he's out
like a light on the sofa or when he's railroading the conversation. Well, do you
want to call him and tell him not to come? Oh, sure. There's nothing mean about
that. Well, you're the one who wants rid of him. And you're the one who keeps
inviting him back. I do not. You literally just did. I did, didn't I? Yeah. Oh,
I'd better get changed too. And tonight, you're doing all the clearing up.
Thanks for coming out for a walk with me. Oh, you don't have to thank me. It's
nice. Walked those pancakes off. They were quite full-on, weren't they? Sorry I
was late tonight. That's OK. You've got a lot on your mind. I have. Especially
after what I said last night. I haven't stopped thinking about it. Since you
said the words, I kept wondering what you meant. You suggesting I go. You could
have asked me. I was right there. Yeah, but I'm a typical man, aren't I? A dumb
bloke who's happy to get lost in his own thoughts and ask for directions. And? I
thought, why is the woman I love looking for a way out? Why is she keen for me
to leave the country? Keen? Lee, that's not what I said, and it's certainly not
what I meant. I spoke to your dad. He was great. He cleared a few things up.
Such as? Such as, what would I say to you if it was your decision to make? And
then I spoke to Alicia. And tonight I'll be speaking to Mabel and Evie
themselves. So you've come to a decision? I have. The way I see it, if you can
be courageous enough to support me moving away to be nearer my girls, even if it
means losing us, then I ought to be man enough to let my girls be happy. To let
them go and try out San Francisco for themselves. I told Alicia I want video
calls, visits in the holidays whenever possible, and I need to trust they'll
always know I'm their dad, know how much I love them. And then I have to do
everything I can to be a meaningful, present part of their lives. So you're
staying? I'm staying. In this way, I get to be a good dad to my daughters. And
to my sons, too. I've been trying these past few days to think of how I might
tell the boys that you might be moving far away. And I just couldn't do it. I
couldn't find the words. Good. Cos I'm not. Ardell has some tough love for Roy,
and Linda is about to up the ante. That's when we return to Ambridge this
evening at seven. Back to this afternoon, our drama Faith, Hope and Glory is
next. But first, let's look ahead to Moneybox Live at three o'clock. Here's Adam
Shaw with details of what's coming up in today's programme. There have been
calls to limit the tax-free lump sum people can take from their pensions and to
increase the state pension age. Internet searches for pension questions have hit
record highs. Add to that a cost-of-living crisis, unstable markets, and the end
of the tax year fast approaching, it all means a lot of people are looking at
their finances and investments. So today we're looking at pensions, investment
portfolios, savings, and any of the financial questions which may have been
bothering you. If you've a question or a concern, you can email us at moneybox
at bbc.co.uk or you can tweet us at Moneybox. Moneybox Live is just after three.
Adam Shaw. Now on Radio 4, the concluding part of the latest series of Faith,
Hope and Glory. It's 1968 and the Biafran War is raging. In Cardiff, Faith and
Trevor find themselves fighting for the future of their nightclub in the
aftermath of Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. Faith and Trevor by Carol
Russell. Mom, I'm starving. Trevor, pass your plate. Serena Hope, take your hand
out the planting. I just want to hear the news. It's too depressing for the
children. Listen to it later, please. Oh, okay. That's better. Do you know the
way to San Jose? I'm going back to find some peace of mind. Daddy, my school's
collecting for the starving Biafran children. Can I have some money, please? We
don't have money to give away. Winston, stop playing with your food. Daddy, do
you know why they're starving? Because there's a famine. And there's a famine
because there's a war. Like the one you told me about in Vietnam. You remember
that? You told her that? Yes. I do listen to you, Daddy. What's this war about?
I can't wait to hear the answer to that. Well, it's a bit like this, the simple
version. On the continent of Africa, there's a piece of land that's home to
three groups of people. One, the biggest, are called the Hausa, and they live in
the north. Another are called the Yoruba, and they live in the west. And the
third are called the Yibo, and they live to the southeast. Serena, I hope this
sounds like it's going to take a while. Don't worry. I'll keep it short. Right.
In 1914, a British man whose name was Frederick Lugard brought these three
groups together and created one country. He called it Nigeria. But this was a
problem because these three groups were so different. I mean, they have
different ways of looking at the world and different things that are important
to them. Hey, are you still with me? Yes, Daddy. What's happened now is that one
of the groups, the Yibo, want their independence. Do you know what I mean? Of
course I do. And time. It means freedom. Well, as me told, the Yibo people, who
have called their country Biafra, want to make their own choices. But the Hausa
people don't want them to be independent, and that's why they're fighting. But
the children are starving because food and medicine can't get to the Biafrans.
Well, I want to help feed the children. Well, this represents to start you off.
Mum, why are you so mean? Because if I left it to your father, he'd give away
every penny we have. And that's why we make such a good team in the lab, eh? Get
up in the morning, sleep in for breakfast. So that every mouth can be... Oh,
you're Israelite. Let's see who that is. Oh, good evening. Good evening. Are you
Mr. Martin? Good evening. Are you Merlene? Yes. Isioma? Yes. Come in. Come in.
Thank you. Take a seat, Isioma. Thank you. At work, they call me Isi. It's
easier. Oh, no. I will call you by your name. Isioma. Because if I can say
Tchaikovsky, I can say Isioma. You are the very first person I have met in this
country who has even tried to say the name my father gave me. Daphne told me you
need help. What can I do for you? I first need for you to understand how it is.
You don't have to tell me the whole story. You can just tell me what I can do to
help. I want you to know I came here to study and left my husband, Ikenna, and
my ten-year-old daughter, Adama, behind. When I left them, my intention was to
get my qualifications and go back home, and the war was nothing but a speck of
dust in the future. When the war began, Ikenna and Adama lived with my mother
close to the border with Cameroon. They lived? Your mother is... Yes. We thought
they were safe because they were out of the way and close to the border. We
thought they would have time to get away. But they didn't. No. My mother was
killed as they left the village. Ikenna took the time to bury her. Maybe...
Maybe if he hadn't, he could have made it across the border with Adama. Instead,
he took the time to kill her. Instead, he drew their fire and sent Adama on with
a neighbour and enough money to get to London. She is here? Yes. But I'm staying
in the nurses' hostel. I finished as a cadet and I'm just six months into my SRN
training. I cannot look after her. And if I stop the training now, I don't know
if they would ever let me back to finish. Do you want me to help you find a
room? No. One of the Nigerian nurses in the hospital where I work told me that
her daughter is fostered by private arrangement with a white family. I need
someone like that. Someone who would foster Adama while I finish my studies. I
can give money for her food and anything she needs. The problem is I need them
tonight. Matron let her stay with me in the hostel last night, but she cannot
stay with me tonight. And the family have to be white? The Nigerian nurse said
that white families are chosen because it gives our children a better chance to
integrate into the country. It puts them ahead, she said. Do you trust me? I
don't have a choice. All right. Fair enough. I know someone who might be able to
help. She's black and has a daughter the same age as Adama. If your daughter has
to be away from you, she might be a little happier if she's with a child her
age. The only problem is my friend doesn't live in London. She lives in Cardiff.
In Wales? When could you get time off? I'm off this Thursday. But what about...
Your daughter can stay with me until then. Thank you, Marlene. If your friend is
anything like you, Adama will be in the best hands. Winston! Don't make me come
up there to you! Hello, Mrs Isaac speaking. How may I help you? Fit! Girl! I
have a big favour to ask. I hope you're not about to tell me you're not coming
for the club's anniversary Friday. Try and stop me. No, one of my nurses needs
help and you are just the person to help her. Oh, after everything your cobweb
of nurses did to help me find joy? Just tell me what she needs. Isioma just lost
her husband and her mother in the Biafran War. And her only daughter Adama
arrived from Nigeria two days ago and needs somewhere to stay. And you thought
of me? How lovely. For how long does Isi... Isioma. Two and a half years, give
or take. Can you do it? Bring her a comb. What about Trevor? Sure. If it was up
to Trevor, this house would be full of children. Plus, Serena hopes I was asking
for a sister. This is the closest she's going to get. Then we will see you on
Thursday afternoon. And I get an extra day with you? I cannot wait. They've
pulled out. And I've tried, Rodri, but he's already booked. Geraint won't answer
the phone and Dewi told me to do one. Oh, what am I missing in Ireland? I've
looked at our accounts for the last six months and we've lost a third of our
revenue. Still making a profit, mind, but only just. When did we start losing
profit? End of April. Then again from the beginning of this month. Why am I not
surprised? Pass our ledger over here. What's that mean, though? Enoch Powell
made his rivers of blood speech on the 20th of April. And looking at these
numbers, by the beginning of May, we'd started to lose audience. That was five
months ago. Do you really think that's the reason people aren't coming and bands
are cancelling? I do. I mean, just the other day I read about him stirring up
more trouble, saying some tripe about immigrants changing the character of
England at the Tory party conference. That's what I think this is. So what are
we going to do? I don't know. We could try a couple of the London boys. Bit
short notice for Friday, I know, but we've got to try. All right, we'll do. But
if I don't have any luck, I think you and Faith should do the anniversary. But
can you believe it's been one whole year? It's been good, though, till the last
few months. You haven't responded to my idea about you and Faith. What do you
think? I could ask her, but I wouldn't know that much out. It might be just a
thing to bring the audience in if people knew it was going to be you and Faith.
In fact, I could call my mate and see if I can sell him a story to the paper he
works for about a black-owned jazz club celebrating its first anniversary in the
middle of Enoch Powers Britain. What do you think? It could work. It'll bring
out those who want to support us. You think you can sell that to Faith? I'll
definitely give it my best shot. Right. Let's drink to that. To resilience and
perseverance. To resilience and perseverance. Right. I'd better get out there
and be the convivial host. You all right, Trev? I'm all right. I just got up too
fast. You sure about that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't look well. Maybe you
should go home. No, no, I'm all right. Just a bit tired. Once we get through the
anniversary celebrations, I'll take a week off. Only got to get to Saturday. Go
on. You get out there. I'll stay in here for a bit. All right. Mummy, what time
are they coming? Oh, if the London train was on time, they'll be here soon.
Wait. Why marry my best dress? To give a good impression. Huh? I want to give
Adama's mother the impression she can trust me with her daughter. Why wouldn't
she trust you? I wouldn't trust many people with you. I would need to know that
they could and would look after you the way I do. Understand? I think so. Do me
a favour. Get the jug of orange squash from the kitchen and bring it come. OK,
Mummy. Take your time with it. I don't want you to spill a single drop. OK,
Mummy. I'm home. I'm in the living room. By the skin of your teeth, man. I know.
I'm sorry. Don't worry. You are here and they are not. You all right? You look
great. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. Just a bit tired. Let me go make
you some sour city. This is them. Daddy, do you think Adama will like me? Of
course she will. Just be yourself, love. I'm scared. It's OK, love. Don't worry.
You sound lovely. You are insightful. Are you all right? I'm all right. It's
Yoma, Adama. It's a pleasure to meet you. Come in, go through. My husband and
daughter are in the living room. Trouble! This is Yoma and her daughter, Adama.
Pleasure to meet you. And you. Adama. Nice to meet you all. What, no booze? Up
to the last minute he was hoping to find someone to take over his shift, but no
luck. Serena Hope, come meet Adama properly. Hello, Aunty Maylene. This is
Adama. Hello, Serena Hope. You have a pretty name. Thank you. So do you. Would
you like to come to my room? Yes, please. Would you like some orange squash,
Miss Yoma? Yes, please. Do one for me, Trevor. Right. So, Maylene tells me
you're looking for a family to look after your daughter while you're studying.
Is that right? Yes. But I'm not sure I like the idea of being so far away from
her. I understand that. I would feel the same. But you need somewhere your
daughter will be looked after. I find any right place to leave a little black,
coloured girl where she will be taken care of. It won't be easy. Most black,
coloured people have to work so it will be hard for them to find a job. The
people I spoke to said it's best to foster our children with white people. It
gives them a better start in England. It gives them a chance to learn about the
country and the culture from the country people. I understand if that's what you
prefer. But you need someone now. That is true. You have a lot of books. My
daddy buys them for me. Have you got lots of books at home? I did. And my father
bought them for me too. Is he coming to England? I don't know. What's your
favourite book? Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren. That's my favourite too.
My favourite thing she does is sleep upside down in bed. Me too. My nae used to
get so upset when she found me sleeping upside down in my bed. What did you just
say? You're what? My nae, my mother. Nae. I like that. How do you say daddy?
Nae. Repeat after me. Nae. Nae. My nae and my nae. My nae and my nae. Is that
your language? Yes. It's called Igbo. And we are Igbo people from Biafra.
Biafra? I've been collecting money to help feed the children in the war. Did you
have enough to eat? I was lucky. We live near the border with Cameroon, so we
were able to get food from there. So you went to the middle of the war? Not
until the end. What happened to you? I think he stayed to fight for our country.
I hope the war ends soon. Me too. Tell me, what worries you about leaving Adama
with us? I've seen how it is to be coloured in this country since I came here
two years ago. And I want it to be easier for Adama. And you think it would be
easier for her if she was fostered by a white family? Yes. If I am paying them,
they will be able to protect her. If she's with a white family, other white
people will accept her. I'm not sure that's true with the old man. And they
won't be able to comfort her when she experiences racialism. I know you only
want the best for your daughter, and you have to trust the people you leave her
with. And you don't know us from our hole in the ground, as the British say. So,
ask us anything. Are you both from the West Indies? No, just me. My mother was
from Ghana, and my father was Somali. And I was born right here, in Cardiff.
It's the only place I know. And I know one other thing. This is my country. Even
though some people might not want me here, I'm British. And no one can take that
away from me. I was born here. I've been here for over 20 years. And I think
that my daughter and yours will make good companions for each other. I don't
know. What is it that you don't know? How is she going to cope without her
father? How am I going to tell her he's not coming back to us? How will she cope
without me? Maybe I should just stop training. Find another job so I can be with
her. Don't do that. What my friend here means is, if you give up your training,
you'll end up in a job in a factory washing bottles or turning out parts for I
don't even know what. Or you could end up cleaning the hospital. You've come
this far. And I know that you, me and every woman who comes here from all over
the world comes to train so that we will be more than a cleaner, more than a
cook, more than a housekeeper. Who knows, you might be the next black matron.
Oh, do people have high hopes for me? The highest. What do you say? Wow, that
was really good. Thank you. You look really sad. Are you all right? I miss my
inner and my bedroom. I want you to have this. But it's your pippi long stocking
book. Did you bring yours with you? No, I couldn't. Then why did you borrow
mine? Thank you, but no. Please take it. I can ask my daddy, my inner, to get me
another one. Go on. If you are sure, thank you. Have you got any brothers or
sisters? No, but I've always wanted a sister. Me too. We could be like blood
sisters. I'd really like that. Oh, I can bring Adama to London to see you
regularly. Oh, only if it's not too much trouble for you. I barely need an
excuse to visit Marley. Trevor, call the girls. There you are. You won't regret
this. You can have my phone number and call whenever you like. Thank you. Adama,
come down here, please. Coming, Daddy. And what about something for you? Like
what? Well, the last Sunday of every month, I have a dinner for friends, new
arrivals and people who don't know anyone in London. And you are welcome to
come. Oh, I would like that. Thank you. Serena Hope, have you been a good host?
Yes, Mummy. If you wish, Adama, you can stay here with Serena Hope. Would you
like that? True, true? True, true. Thank you. Thank you. It looks like I have my
answer. I have to go now, but I will call you over the weekend. Can't hurry,
love, I know you just have to wait. They said love don't come easy. It's a game
of give and take. Hey, that reminds me. How do you fancy singing for the Grace
Notes anniversary? But that's Friday. I know. But we've had a couple of bands
cancel and we haven't got time to find anyone else. Oh, I see. I'm third choice?
No, no, it's not like that. I know, baby. I know. So, will you? Of course I
will. Even if I am last choice. Last choice is better than not being chosen at
all, eh? Come here. Thank you. What for? Putting Isioma at ease. It was nothing.
She seemed like a lovely woman whose world had changed beyond recognition. And
she didn't know what to do for the best. It must be hard losing a husband. And
having your daughter come to find you in a country you don't know. That must be
going through the word head, eh? And it was a good thing Serena Hope likes Adama
too. To be fair, even if Adama had two heads and eight arms and legs, Serena
Hope was always going to like her. It'll be the making of her. So have someone
around who looks like her would do her the world of good. Did you see their
faces when they looked at each other? Like they're in love. Do you think we've
done the right thing? I do. Now, come here woman. The Grace Note, Trevor
speaking. How can I help you? Trevor, it's me. Hey, is everything all right,
Kariad? I've had better days. What's happened? I got a call from Mr Cowper
telling me to collect Serena Hope and Adama and not bring them back until
Monday. Why? What have they done? I was so embarrassed. According to Mr Cowper,
she spent the day shouting and carrying on bad at her school friends, at Mrs
Hughes and Mr Cowper. Has she told you why? Not a single word. And Adama? She's
no better than Serena Hope. You need to talk to your daughter. Okay, look, let's
get the anniversary done tomorrow and I'll have a word at the weekend. Tell you
what, set them some chores so they know we're not happy. We know you're not
happy. What the hell? What is this? I don't know. Bec, we'll see if we can get
inside. Don't touch me. Excuse me, please. We don't want no rivers of blood.
Morgan, is that you? Faith? What are you doing here? You don't know this is mine
and Trevor's club? Shouldn't be your club. Should belong to a white man. When
Trevor was your union rep, get him better pay and better hours for all of you.
You weren't telling him he should have been a white man then. Who do you think
you're talking to? She's talking to you. What you going to do? My friend's going
to a manhandle two women. Your mate is looking for a slap, Faith. You need to
tell her. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on here? Back off. He's only
gone and bought a dirty great cricket bat with him. What you going to do with
that, Trevor? Come on now, boys. You've had your say. Why don't you all go home?
Who are you to tell us where we can be and at what time, eh? Morgan, what are
you doing? Can't you see it's Faith? I can see what it is. And if you don't want
any trouble, you take her and her big mouth friend, close this club, and take
yourselves back to where you came from. I'm from right here in Cardiff, and you
know that. I was born here, grew up here, going to die here, and I'm not going
to let you. Stay back. Trevor. And, Aidan, get Faith and Merlin inside. You're
going to pay for that? Just stay where you are, and there'll be no trouble.
We're going to close you down. I'd like to see you try. Get in, Trevor! How long
have Morgan and them been picketing the club? That just started this week, after
an article came out in the newspapers about the club's anniversary. Why is this
happening? We got Enoch Powell and his Rivers of Blood speech in April, and this
month's speech at the Tory party conference to thank for this. The speech caused
all them people to stand outside our club, shouting abuse at people trying to
get in? A speech? The man was saying what so many were already thinking. Because
he, a big-time politician, said the things that are in their minds, people who
might have been hiding their real feelings now know they don't have to anymore.
And then their numbers make them brave. I thought we were over the worst of
this. So did I. But what's been happening these past few weeks makes me wonder
if we ever will. Didn't Morgan used to come in? Yes. Half of that lot used to
come in at least once a week. How long will you be able to keep the club going?
Tonight is make or break. If we let them scare our audience away, we're
finished. Need you out front. Coming. What's going on? It's got really rough out
there. A couple just came in and said they had to fight their way in. Were they
regulars? Yeah. They said they pushed their way in because they weren't going to
let a picket line stop them from supporting us. Which means how many people have
seen the crowd and decided they don't want any trouble? That was my thought. I
know how much this evening means to you. Right. Here's hoping I don't make
matters worse. I'm going to need the cricket bat. Here's hoping I don't. What
happened to live and let live, eh Morgan? We're not going to let you get the
whip hand over us. When have I ever tried to get the whip hand over you? All I
try to do is help all of us. Brothers in the union. We can look after ourselves.
We don't need you. Look, if you don't like me, that's fine. But all I'm trying
to do is make a living here. What skin is it off your nose, eh? Who threw that?
Who's the coward that hasn't got the guts to face me, eh? If you've got
something to say to me, step up like a man and... Trevor! Dylan! Call an
ambulance! Troy! Troy! Your test results are back. I do have a few questions for
you, though, Mr Isaac. Do you mind if I ask them in front of your wife? She's my
wife. Whatever you've got to say to me, she's going to have to deal with. Just
so you know, Doc, she was a nurse. Even better. So, Mr Isaac, how are you
sleeping? Not so good. I work nights, and we've got two children whose idea of
quiet is... talking to each other at a thousand decibels. So, once they're
awake, that's the death of sleep. Do you find yourself feeling tired but unable
to sleep? Yeah. Happens quite a lot as it goes. OK. How's your appetite? It's
OK. No, it isn't. He's not eating like he did. Oh, come on now, Faith. You've
been leaving more than half the dinner I put on your plate. So, Doctor, his
appetite is not good. Are you more irritable than usual? A bit, I think, but I
run a nightclub, and business is, you know, a bit tough at the moment. I'm
trying not to bring it home, though. That's true. I haven't noticed. Have you
been getting headaches? Yeah. Can you tell me how you felt this last week? Any
pain or shortness of breath, anything like that? And, Mr Isaac, if we're to get
to the bottom of what caused your collapse tonight, you'll need to be honest.
Well, I have felt a bit out of sorts this week, and I've been feeling pain in my
shoulders, neck and back, and a kind of heaviness in my chest, and, you know,
general muscle pain. I mean, I thought I might be getting flu. Have you been
worried about anything? Yeah. Well, I have a bit. As I said, we own a nightclub,
and tonight was our one-year anniversary, and what with everything, we needed it
to be a good night. Has he got heart disease, Doctor? There's no heart disease
at the moment, but your blood pressure is high and you are anemic, and with all
the symptoms you've just spoken about, I'd say you were suffering from chronic
stress, and that puts you at an increased risk of chronic hypertension, heart
attack and stroke. Stress? Stress can do that? It sounds as if you've got a lot
on your plate right now, and it's causing you to be worried, which is natural,
but when you've been worried for more than a few weeks, the condition becomes
chronic, and all the symptoms you've been experiencing point to chronic stress.
How can we alleviate this condition? Well, we can give you something to bring
your blood pressure down and possibly a short course of sleeping tablets so that
you can get some rest. The reason for that is that a lack of sleep amplifies all
your other symptoms, especially the worry and anxiety. Do you have any
questions, Mr Isaac? Thank you, Doctor. Can Trevor go home today? Yes. I'll just
go and organise the drugs for him. Shouldn't be long. Things are going to have
to change. I know, Carly. Starting with the club. I'm not giving it up. You
heard what the doctor said. A night in can manage the club. But that's not going
to stop you worrying about it. I'm too old to go back to the docks. We've got to
have something bringing money in. I worry about that too. I will go and find a
job. I don't want that. You don't have a choice. You heard what the doctor said.
You have to rest. Not forever, Cariad. And we're going to have to get in touch
with Isioma and tell her because of your health we cannot manage Adama. Why not?
I agreed with you when you told Isioma she could send what she could afford. But
everything has changed. Not everything. Adama still needs a home where she'll be
safe. We can still give her that. Trevor. I can't, Faith. She's lost enough as
it is. She's buried her grandmother. She doesn't know what's happened to her
father. And she's miles away from her mother with a bunch of strangers. I mean,
how do you think she'd feel if we chucked her out and all? But, Trevor, we have
to make changes. Because you collapsed last night, there was no anniversary,
which means we're probably going to have to give people back their money. Didn't
you say last night was the make or break? Yes, I did say that. But I've had an
idea how to make it work. For now, Anayren runs the club. And we get his friends
to write an article that the club is now under new management. You're going to
give the club to Anayren? No. We're going to put it about that the club is under
new management. White management. That will turn the business around. But we'll
still own it. All right. I see. You know, I was just thinking of you, right? I
know, Cariad. But she's just a little girl. So, you agree? Yes, I agree. But let
me make one thing clear. I am going to get a job. Mmm, looks delicious. Adama,
hurry up, please. Winston, stop playing with Anaca. Don't make me come out
there. Serena Hope, keep your eye on the soup, please. Don't let it dry out.
Trevor? Trevor? Serena Hope is your fetching carrier. Do not get up. Here you
are, Cariad. Here I am, Auntie Fitz. Good. Oh, Serena's coat fits you. All
right, let's go. Bring back sweeties for me, please. That's better, that is.
We've got the house all to ourselves. Hey, what about some music, eh? Can we
play Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay? Ah, now that's a good idea, that is. Come
here, sit by me, eh? So, what's going on between you and Adama? What did she
say? She didn't say anything. I've just seen how it is with the two of you. You
both look so sad. You know you can talk to me about anything, don't you, Cariad?
Yes. So, tell me what happened, because I know something happened. I don't know,
Daddy, but she's been angry with me since the first day of school. Tell me what
happened. We were talking to my friends, and Cariad, and Caris, and a couple of
other girls, and they were asking lots of questions. What kind of questions? At
first, just, how old are you, and where do you come from? Then, what did they
ask? They asked if she lived in a tree, and pretended not to understand her when
she was trying to tell them that she didn't. And what did you do, Cariad? I got
frightened. I didn't say anything. They've never been like that before, Daddy.
Then what happened? They asked if we had tails. They asked you what? If we had
tails. Then what happened? I shouted at Cariad and told her I didn't have a
tail, because I didn't come from Africa. Then what happened? That's when Adama
ran away. Ah, I see why Adama's angry with you. Why? Well, she felt like you
abandoned her. But she was the one that ran away from me, and wouldn't talk to
me. Because, you see, she thought that you were saying that you weren't like
her. Like you were ashamed of being the same as her, an African. Were you
ashamed? I mean, you know, just a little bit. A little bit, yes. Well, I got
something to tell you. You are African. My mam, my mamé, is from Ghana. And my
dad, my abu, is from Somalia. I'm Cardiff-born, of African stock. And that means
you are too. Really? And I'm proud to be African and Welsh. Can I have some
money? Nah. Nah? What's that then? It's Ibo for Daddy. Adama taught me. I like
it. Now, what do you need the money for, Cariad? I want to get Adama a present.
Oh, is that right? Hello, Adama. Hello. I got something for you. What is this?
They're called jacks. Why have you given them to me? To say sorry for what
happened at school. I should have defended you when Carys and Ngarhana had been
all about you. Why didn't you? I was scared. They've never been like that with
me before. But that doesn't matter. I shouldn't have let them get away with it.
Sorry. What is it that you do with them? Play a game. Can you show me? I come
bearing saltfish fritters and sorrel from Auntie Marlene. What are saltfish
fritters? They're hard to describe. Taste one. Mmm. This is delicious, Auntie
Faye. You have to show me how to make it. Oh, you can cook? Of course. Oh, wow.
I was cooking when I was your age, too. Can I learn as well? Shall we allow it,
Adama? Of course. Man, look at them, na. This is what they play in, Jacks. To
tell you the truth, I never think we'd see them like this again. What you say to
Serena Hope, Trevor? I just helped her talk about what happened and work out
what she needed to do next. You're going to have to show me how to do that.
Because my two girls may be big women now, but Lord have mercy, when they're
ready to fuss and fight, weeks can pass before they speak to each other.
Watching the two of them reminds me of me and Hope playing when we were their
age in Antigua. It's been too many years since I lost all hope, and five years
since I found her daughter Joy, who I thought I'd lost forever. She'd be an
adult now, more able to understand what happened. And it's time. What are you
saying, Faye? I'm saying it's time for Hope and Joy to know each other now. You
sure you're ready for what that might stir up? Faye? Faith, Hope and Glory
