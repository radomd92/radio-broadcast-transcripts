 I think they suit the farmers and the farmers suit the buzzards and both of
them suit me. Hello, it's six o'clock on Thursday the 23rd of February. This is
Today with Nick Robinson in Berlin and Amol Rajan in London. The headlines this
morning, Sakhir Starmer is unveiling five national missions, including securing
the highest economic growth in the G7 that Labour will prioritise if it wins
power. We'll be speaking to Sakhir live at ten past eight. An off-duty police
officer has been critically hurt in a shooting in Oma, sparking condemnation
from politicians across Northern Ireland. Also in today's programme, I'm in
Berlin to examine the dramatic turnaround in German attitudes to peace and war
since the invasion of Ukraine and the angsting that that has produced. Germany's
economics minister has this reply to those in Britain who say his country has
not done enough. Do I politely ask how many refugees from Ukraine the United
Kingdom welcomed? And... David Bowie's personal archive has been acquired by the
Victoria and Albert Museum and will be on display in London in a couple of
years' time. The collection includes the handwritten lyrics to songs including
heroes recorded here in Berlin. The BBC News is read this morning by Chris
Aldridge. The Labour leader, Sakhir Starmer, is launching what he calls five
national missions, outlining his plans for the UK if his party wins the next
general election. The commitments will be formally announced during a speech in
Manchester this morning, as well as details about how the first pledge, securing
the highest economic growth in the G7, will be achieved. Our political
correspondent Helen Catt reports. Labour says its five missions will be
unashamedly long-term, an alternative to what it calls the sticking plaster
solutions of Rishi Sunak's five priorities for government. The first two
missions will be to secure the highest sustained economic growth in the G7 and
to make Britain a clean energy superpower. Sakhir will say that his missions are
not just another word for priorities or promises, but would form a different way
of governing. Labour will unveil goals for its final three missions, building an
NHS fit for the future, making Britain's streets safe and breaking down barriers
to opportunity in the coming months. Politicians in Northern Ireland have
condemned the shooting of an off-duty police officer in Oma in County Tyrone
last night. He's in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Sinn FÃ©in's
vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, described the attack as outrageous and
shameful. The DUP leader, Sir Geoffrey Donaldson, has called for those
responsible to be brought to justice. From Belfast, our Ireland correspondent
Emma Vardy reports. The shooting happened in front of young people at a football
coaching session, according to a local Ulster Unionist Assembly member, Tom
Elliott, who called it a despicable and cowardly attack. It's thought the off-
duty officer was shot multiple times, at around eight o'clock in the evening.
Irish police have increased patrols in neighbouring counties, after reports the
gunman may have fled across the border after the attack. There's continued to be
a security threat against police officers in Northern Ireland since the end of
the Troubles 25 years ago, but attacks are now much rarer. The government has
confirmed that a new independent regulator of men's football in England is to be
established for the first time. It'll aim to make clubs more financially
sustainable and ensure money from the Premier League filters down to lower
divisions, our sports editor Dan Rowan reports. The independent football
regulator is designed to prevent a repeat of the failings that led to the
collapse of Bury FC in 2019, one of a host of clubs to suffer financial crisis
in recent years. The body would oversee a licensing system to ensure clubs are
run sustainably, be responsible for a strengthened owners and directors test and
could block teams from joining breakaway competitions like the European Super
League. With the Football League wanting a greater share of the Premier League's
record wealth and the FA pushing for more funding for grassroots football, the
regulator could also intervene to decide how much money flows down the pyramid.
The cases of 12,000 asylum seekers are to be fast-tracked by the Home Office to
try to fulfil Rishi Sunak's pledge to reduce the backlog of applications by the
end of the year. Migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen will
have their claims decided on the basis of a 10-page questionnaire which must be
completed in English within 20 days. Here's our Home Editor Mark Easton. The
Home Office insists this is not an asylum amnesty but a way to streamline the
processing system for five nationalities which have an asylum acceptance rate of
more than 95%. All the usual security and criminal checks will be conducted and
biometrics taken. But for the first time a cohort of 12,000 asylum seekers will
not be required to attend a face-to-face interview. The British Red Cross is
among organisations concerned that insisting asylum seekers complete a
questionnaire in English and return it within 20 days could increase the
suffering of already traumatised individuals. Members of the United Nations
General Assembly are likely to adopt a resolution later today condemning
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The text also calls for peace to be achieved as
soon as possible. Moscow has described the resolution as unbalanced but it has
no veto over the General Assembly. The National Trust says the Farn Islands off
the coast of Northumberland will be closed to visitors from April to see whether
a reduction in tourism helps limit the spread of avian flu. More than 6,000
birds died from the virus on the islands last year. Our North of England
correspondent Fiona Trotch reports. The farms off the Northumberland coast are
traditionally home to around 200,000 seabirds. The National Trust says
gillimoths and kittywakes were worst affected by avian flu last year and rangers
fear there will be thousands of cases this year because the virus has persisted
throughout the winter. As birds return to nest the decision has been taken to
restrict access to sailing tours only from April the 1st to see if limiting the
disturbance on the islands will make a difference to the spread of the disease.
Fiona Trotch reporting. Thanks Chris. Six minutes past six. Let's take our first
visit to the BBC Weather Centre. Waiting for us there Darren Bett. Morning
Darren. Good morning Nick. Quite a contrast across the UK at the moment. The
southern half of the UK is cloudy. There's still a bit of rain left over.
Further north we've got some clearer skies and in Scotland in particular it's a
cold start this morning with a frost in places. We will see the weather though
changing in Scotland. Some southern and eastern parts of the country will keep
the sunshine throughout the morning but further northwest it will be turning
more cloudy as a west to southwesterly wind strengthens and we'll see that cloud
arriving across southern and eastern parts of Scotland during the afternoon by
which time northern Scotland and particularly the highlands will be turning
wetter and windier with some strong winds here. Across Northern Ireland chilly
start here. Sunshine through the morning. A bit more cloud in the afternoon.
Likely to stay dry. Not as windy as it will be in Scotland and across England
and Wales. Well northern England having a decent day actually. A lot of sunshine
to come today. Any showers running in around North Sea Coast won't last long at
all. Further south across England and into Wales we start the day with much more
cloud. We've still got some patchy rain as well. The cloud and the rain will
push its way southwards through the day. The rain petering out during the
afternoon. Southern parts of England staying cloudy for most of the day but we
will see the cloud breaking up in Wales and the Midlands this morning. Sunshine
coming through here and sunshine arriving across East Anglia in the afternoon.
It will be a chillier day though today. Temperature wise we're looking at around
seven to nine degrees and heading into the coming nights across Wales, the
Midlands, southern England there could be an early frost before we see the cloud
that's in the north moving its way further south. Darren thank you very much
indeed. Let's have a look at this morning's papers and what's on the news
websites. A number lead with the government's plan to reduce the asylum backlog
by scrapping interviews for some migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria,
Yemen and Libya. The Daily Mail says the fast lane has been dubbed an amnesty in
all but name and warns it's been told by a senior source that the change would
encourage other people from the five countries to come to the UK. The
Conservative MP Marco Longhi tells the Daily Telegraph that the scheme appears
to be completely wrong and people who'd entered the UK illegally should be
removed and have their claims processed overseas but the Daily Express says the
plan is a practical solution to a long-standing problem. Just take no for an
answer is the Sun's message to Sharmima Begum after the former member of the
Islamic State group lost a legal bid to restore her British citizenship. The
paper says her lawyers boasted that the battle was nowhere near over and appeals
are set to cost the taxpayer millions. An editorial in the Times says the
government hasn't yet given a convincing answer on why Sharmima Begum must not
return to the UK or what threat she still poses that couldn't be countered by
close monitoring. The paper acknowledges that keeping an eye on her would take
up scarce security resources but adds that punishing people by leaving them
stateless in a desert is no answer to terrorism. The Daily Telegraph highlights
a warning from BT that the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will send Britain in a quote
drastically anti-investment direction if he forges ahead with an increase in
corporation tax. The chief financial officer of the telecoms firm Simon Louth
fears the increase from 19 to 25 percent will reduce business investment and
slow down economic growth. The Times says it's seen a draft of an NHS plan to
tackle staff shortages in the health service. The document warns that the NHS
will be short of more than half a million workers without the biggest boost in
training for a generation. It calls for a doubling of medical school places by
the end of the decade which would require half a dozen new medical schools.
According to the Guardian pollutants known as forever chemicals which build up
in the body may be toxic and do not break down in the environment. They have
been found at high levels across the UK and Europe. The paper says the chemicals
valued for their non-stick and detergent properties have made their way into the
soil water and sediments from consumer products, firefighting foams, waste and
industrial processes. In the UK the highest level was detected in a discharge
from a chemicals plant on the River Wyre near Blackpool. And almost all the
papers feature images of the late musician David Bowie in some of his
extraordinary costumes which have now been gifted to the nation. The Mirror says
his personal archive is donating a collection of handwritten lyrics, letters,
sheet music, costumes, photography, music videos, album artwork and awards to
the V&A, the Victoria and Albert Museum which will open the David Bowie Centre
for the Study of Performing Arts in a couple of years time. And we're going to
be talking to the curator at the V&A and someone who lived with David Bowie back
in the early days of his career. That'll be later in the programme. The time now
in London at least is 11 minutes past six. Yes, an hour later here in Berlin
where this weekend protests will be staged in German towns and cities calling on
the government to stop supplying arms to Ukraine and start talking to Russia
about a diplomatic solution. I'm joined in our temporary Berlin studio by a
Berlin correspondent Damien McGuinness. Morning to you Damien. Good morning
Nick. Now these protests are controversial but behind them lies a petition with
what more than half a million names attached to it. A sign of German angst? I
think certainly a part of a very ferocious debate about how Germany is
supporting Ukraine and Germany is supporting Ukraine massively financially with
huge military arms but also taking in more than a million Ukrainian refugees.
However it's not representative of the mainstream opinion here in Germany. The
political consensus and the mainstream voter opinion is definitely full support
for Ukraine both in a humanitarian sense but also when it comes to sending arms.
What this is though is a sign at I think you could say the most radical end of
society that there should be an immediate ceasefire. This manifesto for peace
which was launched last week calls on the west to stop sending arms and to
freeze the conflict which would effectively mean the occupied territories remain
under Russian control and those abuses of power would carry on. Those questions
haven't been answered. The reason why this is not representative that even if
there are big numbers on Saturday which are unlikely they likely will be is that
the the leads of this are extremely radical. Saare Wagenknecht, a radical left-
wing politician is even being threatened being thrown out of her own party. The
radical radical left are not supporting it. The far right are not supporting it.
Within this demonstration you have conspiracy theorists and you have Kremlin
apologists but I think it's a sign of a nervousness and a fiery debate, a
ferocious row really within society about where we are going with this war. So
in that sense it is a very visible signal of what is an incredibly lively debate
here in Germany and it is ongoing. A lively debate because of how far the
country's moved since you and I sat in this very spot around about a year ago
and the Germans were being attacked for supplying only 5,000 military helmets to
Ukraine. Dramatic changes which are not comfortable for everybody. Absolutely.
This is a different country to when we last talked shortly after Chancellor
Schwarz gave his so-called a titan vendor speech. He talked about a change in
the times, a change in history, a turning point in history. Now I think when he
gave that speech and that phrase which everyone's become familiar with titan
vendor at the time a lot of people interpreted it as meaning Germany was going
to do an historic turning point. What he actually was saying when you listen
carefully he was saying the times have changed, history has changed, Germany has
to change as well and Germany has changed and if you look at it in that way what
he was saying is Germany is journey Germany's on a journey and that journey
isn't finished. So it's the start of a debate and it's the start of Germany
throwing aside its ties with Russia, shifting its whole view of how it deals
with this key ally, key trading partner, energy partner in the past which has
now become effectively a strategic enemy. That has all been turned around on its
head and key parts of German foreign policy in terms of like sending arms to the
conflict zones have been thrown aside. So this is a different country to 12
months ago. Damian for the moment thank you we're going to be hearing a lot of
voices over the next three hours from here in Germany as well as from a refugee
centre at Tegel airport here in Berlin. 14 minutes past six and it's a big day
in British football because there has been this where there is going to be the
publication of this fan-led review into the future of English football and there
are some big proposals. Let's discuss them with Dan Rowan our sports editor.
Morning Dan, this comes after years of crisis at several clubs you've reported
on and mostly those clubs aren't in the top tier of English football. Morning
Amol yes that's right this is certainly one of the biggest structural overhauls
football in England has seen and yes it is the key recommendation this
independent regulator of a fan-led review that was designed to avoid a repeat of
the financial mismanagement and failings that led to the collapse of perhaps
most infamously Bury FC one of the most historic clubs in the country in 2019
when it was expelled from the football league but it's just one of a host of
clubs in honesty Amol as you suggested to suffer financial issues in recent
years with the likes of Derby County, Macclesfield Town and others falling into
administration in recent years. This new body would oversee a licensing system
that would try and ensure that clubs are run sustainably, take over a
strengthened owners and directors test, give fans a greater say in key decisions
and it would also be able to block teams from joining the kind of breakaway
competitions that we saw a couple of years ago with the European Super League.
This all comes at a time as well when the football league wants a greater share
of the Premier League's record wealth and agreements yet to be reached between
the football authorities over a new financial settlement and the regulates the
government have confirmed would also have this backstop power enabling it to
intervene to resolve how much money will flow down the pyramid. And what's the
reaction been Dan? The Premier League Amol said that it recognised the case for
change but that it was vital any regulation didn't deter investment or reduce
its competitiveness through unintended consequences. This comes of course at a
fascinating moment with Manchester United up for sale and the subject of multi-
billion pound takeover bids. The league believes it already gives enough money
away around half a billion a year in this current three-year cycle and it's
making changes already. Most clubs didn't want an independent regulator and
believe the FA should have remained in charge. The government believes that
while it wants to preserve the Premier League's popularity and success an
overhaul is now needed for the good of the wider game. Labour said that years
however had been wasted reaching this point and I think some campaigners would
have liked to have seen the regulator given the power to immediately intervene
and dictate perhaps exactly how much money flows down from the top to the lower
leagues. It's such important issues Dan thank you and we'll be speaking to Rick
Parry the former boss of the Premier League around about 10 to 7 and then the
sports minister around about half past seven. 17 minutes past six now the
government's announced it's going to look at more ways to support industry like
steel and chemicals to industries that have vast energy costs. Phyllis Deanna
has more on that and the rest of today's business news. Morning Phyllis. Morning
yes the government says it's going to consult on scrapping certain green levies
for heavy energy users as well as reducing network charges. Those are the
industry equivalent of the standing charges on household energy bills. Now this
comes after British Steel announced yesterday that it was shutting its coking
ovens in Scunthorpe and cutting up to 260 jobs. The company said its energy
bills and the cost of carbon offsetting increased by 190 million pounds last
year and that decisive action was needed. Gareth Stace is Director General of UK
Steel which represents the sector. Gareth good morning. Good morning Phyllis.
What did you make of this announcement from the government? Well it was very
welcome. UK industrial electricity prices have been uncompetitive for many many
years and so today the announcement from government is really welcome. It goes a
long way to bridging the gap between what we pay for electricity and what our
competitors in say Europe, in France and Germany pay but there is still some way
to go. The gap at the moment before this government announcement is something
like 60 percent more that we pay than a steel company in Germany pays. So
there's a long way to go and we look forward to working with government to
bridge that gap and make us competitive within Europe and globally. You say you
look forward to working with government. This is a consultation. We're not going
to see any of these changes straight away. How does that affect your industry?
And that's particularly concerning. You know we might see our electricity prices
going down in just over a year's time. Well just over a year's time is a long
time in steel and you've just talked, Phyllis, about the announcement yesterday
from British Steel and my fear is if we don't see a competitive electricity
prices and carbon prices and other costs and trade policy, if we don't see a
competitive business environment here in the UK for the steel sector, we won't
see investments and my fear is we might see more announcements like we had
yesterday in the next year or so. What about though the importance of those
green levies for meeting our climate commitments, especially when it comes from
such an energy intensive industry like yours? Yeah, well UK Steel, representing
the steel sector in the UK, last summer set out its roadmap for net zero to
2050. We've set it out to the whole journey, how much it costs, what
technologies we'll use and incidentally every single solution for us as steel to
get to net zero involves us using more electricity, not less and therefore if
electricity prices are uncompetitive here in the UK our journey to net zero
stops right here. We can't move any further but if we look across the world in
Europe and actually in Canada and elsewhere, governments there are providing
billions, not millions, billions to their steel sector to help them in a joint
effort to get from where they are now, it's highly carbon intensive, to net zero
in the next 10, 15, 20 years and we'd like to see more of that here, that scale
of capex that we need because it's enormously expensive to get to net zero for a
sector like steel. British Steel said that it was energy bills but also carbon
offsetting costs that had increased. How costly is decarbonising for an industry
like steel? Well even those costs that British Steel talked about yesterday were
just compliance costs with the UK emissions trading scheme and for the sector in
the UK that's 120 million pounds a year that we pay to treasury, to government
and what does that do? Well it doesn't help us on our journey to net zero, it
takes that money away from us and if you think of investment in the steel sector
per year it's about 200 million pounds. Well imagine what we could do if we had
an extra 120 million pounds let alone significant government support to help us
on that journey to net zero. I'm sure a lot of different sectors would like an
extra 120 million pounds a year, why is it that the UK steel sector is so
particularly important would you say? Well it's important because if you think
of in a modern society, a modern economy, everything is either made of steel or
made using steel. We're a foundation sector that feeds into almost every other
manufacturing sector in the UK and if you look at renewables technologies and
net zero technologies, every single one of those technologies needs steel. So
why wouldn't we make that steel here in the UK rather than, which would be a
disaster from my point of view, that we'd import steel, we don't know where it's
come from, we don't know the carbon footprint of it, we don't know how far it's
come and so therefore the solution here would be to have a strong and
competitive steel sector here in the UK. How important is steel to our exports
as a country? Well every year with our costs being higher than our competitors,
we're exporting slightly less and less and less every year. We're seeing imports
of steel going up, up, up every year and our production of steel going down.
Unfortunately in 2022 we produced only six million tons of steel in the UK.
That's the equivalent or the last time we did that was in 1932 when the UK was
building the Battersea Power Station. So this isn't a good situation to be in.
Steel demand globally is increasing year on year. We should be part of that, not
looking at us withering on the vine because our costs are uncompetitive here in
the UK. Gareth Stace, Director General of UK Steel, thank you very much for
joining us this morning. While we're talking about the price of energy and
steel, let's turn to inflation. There is a more optimistic forecast from the
banking giant Citigroup. This morning it's predicting that UK inflation could
return to 2% by autumn. It reckons the rapid fall in gas prices will ease the
economic crisis and we'll see figures dropping from the double digits that we've
seen to something a lot closer to the Bank of England's target of 2%. I'm joined
now by Louise Dudley, Portfolio Manager of Global Equities at Federated Hermes.
Louise, good morning. Good morning. This sounds almost too good to be true. Yes,
certainly good news for consumers if some of those prices start coming down a
bit sooner and certainly no more interest rate hikes coming in. But perhaps a
bit of also kind of a negative outlook in the sense that if those rates are
coming down, if the prices are coming down so much stronger, perhaps that's an
indication that they're expecting a deeper recession for the UK. And so,
therefore, it's maybe a little bit of kind of good news equals bad news. But
well done to the Bank of England in the sense that this is even beyond their
expectations in terms of targeting inflation coming down quicker than their
models are predicting. We can't just have a good news story. There has to be a
bad news element. But no, of course, we should say that inflation falling
doesn't mean things will get cheaper. It just means that the rate at which
they're getting more expensive will slow. Let's talk quickly about Tesla. It's
scaled back its plans to make batteries for its electric vehicles in Germany.
That's after it's been won over by the United States Inflation Reduction Act.
That's an act that involves subsidies, tax credits for producing electric
vehicles, renewable electricity, other green tech sectors over in the States.
And it also provides money off for consumers who buy US-made electric cars. The
EU has expressed concern that hundreds of billions of dollars worth of subsidies
in the US will encourage more companies to abandon Europe for the States. Is it
right to be concerned? I think it is. But actually, quite good to see that the
US has really joined the net zero race and that they are becoming more
competitive. I think there is no such thing as a subsidy-free electron that
people are getting paid on different sides, different subsidies that come in.
But the fact that the US has joined and put out such a huge amount of spending,
kind of really accelerating that transition towards the kind of green energy is
going to be really positive for EVs, for batteries, bringing the cost down for
US consumers, which is obviously a huge market. And we do expect that some of
the European industrials will also be lured over by some of these incentives as
well. Louise Dudley, thank you very much for joining us. Well, we're talking a
lot about prices. We've talked about the price of steel. Now, let's talk about
the price of a meal. Food and drink price inflation in the food service sector
fell slightly in January, the first drop since September 2021. This is according
to data from the CGA Prestige Food Service Price Index. Its report for January
shows a small decline in the pace at which prices are increasing down to 22%
from 22.9% in December. Karen Errington is the co-owner of the award winning The
Rat Inn gastropub in Enoch, Northumberland. Karen, good morning. Good morning,
Felicity. This report still suggests prices in the food service industry are
rising very fast. What are you seeing? Well, as you've just reported before,
we've seen no reduction in prices. Prices are still going up. Only last week, we
had a Â£22 per keg increase on a keg of beer. So, these are significant prices
that really have to be passed on to the customer. How much have you had to raise
your prices? Well, it depends what the item is, what the dish is on the menu. I
mean, there's lots of hidden costs. I mean, everybody knows the price of oil
went up significantly. You know, we went from paying Â£19 for a drum of oil to
Â£39 and hidden costs, things like blue roll, which every kitchen uses vast
quantities of, we were paying Â£6.95 per six pack of those prior to COVID. And,
you know, now they're Â£16 or more if you can get them at that price. So, there's
lots of hidden costs that all impact on the actual price of your menu item. How
are your consumers responding to higher prices when they're having to tighten
their own belts? Well, we've had to look at prices very closely because margins
are tight at the minute, tighter than they've ever been. So, whereas in the
past, we might have absorbed a few price increases, we can't afford to do that
now. So, there's no longer any wiggle room in prices. So, you know, looking at
if prices remain static and we can avoid any further increases to the customer,
then that's going to be good and people will be more confident. But generally,
as the way the business has gone, if you'd asked me that question in December, I
would have been worried because December started off quite slowly and Christmas
was compacted into a much shorter timescale this year. Early December was slow,
but things picked up and then between Christmas and New Year, it was very busy.
And then actually, surprisingly, January and February have been very good,
better than we could have expected or hoped for. And we're seeing customers
buying premium items like steaks and ribs and beef, etc. So, we are feeling
slightly encouraged, but it's still like very uncertain times. And, you know, if
we can just keep things static, that's going to help us loads. Karen, it's good
to hear you're having some good news so far this year. Karen Errington, co-owner
of the Rat Inn Gastropub in Anick, Northumberland. Thank you. Phyllis, thank you
very much indeed. 29 minutes past six, Gary's here with us for and no doubt your
lead story this morning, Gary, is the revelation that a 40-year-old from
Lancashire is at the top of the bowling rankings for Test Cricket. You'd never
make an editor if you think that's the lead. Good morning. We're talking about
James Anderson, actually. Brilliant, Jimmy Anderson, 40. Devon Malcolm is my
guest in an hour and we're going to be hearing from Ben Stokes in a second.
Before we do that, the really big story this morning, Wales against England is
on. The Six Nations game had been in doubt, but the Welsh players have decided
against strike action after a dispute about contracts. And here's Captain Ken
Owens. Of course, it's been a distraction obviously with everything that's going
on, but I've got to commend the players' professionalism in this. There's
obviously been a lot of conversations, you know, within team rooms, that type of
stuff. But when we've got across that white line of training, we've prepared
well, we've done our work as professional rugby players and we'll be ready for
Saturday. As we heard on the programme a short time ago, full details about an
independent regulator for football will be released today. There'll be more on
the story again in around 20 minutes. Manchester City had lots of chances, but
their game in Leipzig finished 1-1 in the Champions League. Riyad Mahrez scored
their goal. England 6, Belgium 1. Two goals from Chloe Kelly and two from Leah
Williamson helped England make it three wins from three in the cup competition
they've been playing in and they retained the trophy. They're now unbeaten in 29
matches. It's a great run of form ahead of the World Cup, says Chloe Kelly. We
keep building momentum. There's a good few months before the tournament starts,
so I think it's been in the right shape come the summer. But I think we just
have to go back to club now, stay fit, stay healthy and keep learning, keep
building and just enjoy our football. Well, so too, cricket and England have
named an unchanged team for the second test with New Zealand, which starts
tonight in Wellington. Jimmy Anderson, now 40, he's returned to the top of ICC's
bowling rankings after he finished with 7 for 54 in the first test. Here's
captain Ben Stokes. I can't see him stopping. He's just every time he turns out
there, he's one of the main guys you throw the ball to when you feel like you
need a wicket. And he's just relentless with everything that he does. I'm very
lucky to have him. I know sometimes those rankings and stuff don't really mean
that much to people, but I think in my opinion and our opinion, he's been one of
the best, if not the best for longer than what these rankings say. A tough
three-set win has taken Andy Murray through to the quarterfinals of the Qatar
Open. He beat Alexander Zverev 7-6, 2-6, 7-5. Here are the tips. One for
Sedgefield, 3-15, number three, first man. Then we're off to Huntington at four
o'clock, number two, William Cody. Gary, thank you very much indeed. As we
approach the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, James Nocte has been
looking at a war which has so far defied predictions. The world looks to the
battlefields of Ukraine and asks how and when will it end? Both sides speak of
all-out victory, but could there be a settlement between the enemies? This is
James Nocte and I've been exploring with diplomats and peacemakers the lessons
of other conflicts to see how they might help in finding a pathway through the
smoke of battle. After nearly a year of war, when might the talking start to
matter more? How wars end on BBC Radio 4, available now on BBC Sounds. 28
minutes to seven. You're listening to Today on BBC Radio 4 with Nick Robinson in
Berlin and Amal Rajan in London. Here's a summary of the news from Chris
Aldridge. Sakhir Starmer is to outline his plans for the UK if he becomes Prime
Minister. He's calling them Labour's five national missions and says they'll
form the backbone of the party's manifesto for the next general election. The
missions include securing the highest economic growth in the G7 and building an
NHS fit for the future. In a speech in Manchester this morning, Sakhir will say
the country needs a serious plan if it is to fix deep-seated problems. Political
leaders in Northern Ireland have condemned the shooting of an off-duty police
officer in Oma in County Tyrone. He's in a critical but stable condition in
hospital. Sinn FÃ©in's Vice President Michelle O'Neill described the attack as
outrageous and shameful. The DUP leader Sir Geoffrey Donaldson has called for
those responsible to be brought to justice. The government has announced plans
for a new independent regulator of men's football in England. It'll aim to make
clubs more financially sustainable and ensure money from the Premier League
filters down the football pyramid. The Home Office says 12,000 asylum seekers
will be considered for refugee status without face-to-face interviews. A 10-page
questionnaire will be used to assess the cases of people from Afghanistan,
Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen who applied before last July. The United Nations
General Assembly is expected to approve a resolution that condemns Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and calls for peace as soon as possible. The vote will take
place today, on the eve of the first anniversary of the conflict. Israel has
carried out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after rockets were fired from the
Palestinian-controlled territory. The rocket attacks followed the deaths of 11
Palestinians during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank yesterday.
Scotland's public spending watchdog has warned that staff shortages, rising
costs and lengthening waiting lists are jeopardising the Scottish government's
plan to help the NHS recover from Covid. Audit Scotland's annual report says
ministers should be more transparent with patients about the unprecedented
challenges facing the health service. The Scottish government says its recovery
plan is backed by record investment. Chris, thank you very much indeed and to
Politics and that lead story that Chris mentioned. With Nick Earley, our Chief
Political Correspondent. Morning Nick. You've had a look at this, this is a
mission statement from Keir Starmer which Chris mentions. He's launching it in
Salford and Manchester this morning. What'd you make of it? Morning. Well yes, I
mean for a while we had politics in three-word slogans, now it's in pledges of
five. We had the Prime Ministers earlier in the year and today we'll get
Labour's missions. I think they're going to be the spine of what Labour tries to
pitch to the electorate before the next general election. So in that sense they
are quite a big deal. I think we'll hear a lot about them and we know what they
are. There's the economy securing the highest growth in the G7. That's quite a
bold plan but we don't have a time frame for it yet. Climate, zero carbon,
electricity by 2030. Securing the NHS for the future, making streets safe and
breaking down barriers to opportunity which I would expect to focus on reforming
childcare and education. As I say, I think we're going to hear a lot about these
from the Labour Party. Keir Starmer is convinced that this is the pitch which
can win him the next general election. As ever though, the devil with these
things is in the detail. I think it's going to take a while before we know
exactly what the so-called measurable outcomes from these are. The bigger
question is how does Keir Starmer deliver them? Nick, very briefly, he's on at
ten past eight. What shall I ask him? Well how are you going to get that growth
that you're promising? There's a big debate playing out in politics already
about whether you do it by cutting tax. Where does he stand on some of those big
questions about corporation tax and personal taxes as well? I think there is a
broader question is are these more than just slogans? How does Keir Starmer
persuade everybody that these are proper plans that he would be able to enact as
Prime Minister? He's riding high in the polls just now. There are a lot of
people in Westminster convinced he's the next PM. There's going to be a lot more
scrutiny too. Indeed. Starting at ten past eight. Nick Hurdley, good to talk to
you. Thanks. We'll have some other suggestions for you during the program as
well. It's 23 minutes to seven now. On the eve of the anniversary of the
invasion of Ukraine, the UN General Assembly will debate a resolution tonight
condemning Russia and calling for the complete, immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all her troops. Those watching in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv,
will not be holding their breath for Russia to comply with that. Lise Doucette,
our Chief International Correspondent, is back in the Ukrainian capital and
joins us now. Morning to you, Lise. Words, will they matter? Well, they're
symbols, Nick, and in diplomacy symbols do matter. First of all, the United
Nations, in particular the UN Secretary General, has to be seen to be doing
something. Invading another country by force is a violation of the United
Nations Charter. But it's also about the United States, its allies in Ukraine,
who want to see this as a Manichean moment, black and white, good and evil.
That's how Ukraine's foreign minister put it. And last October, a similar
resolution did have 143 countries condemning it, but 35 abstained and five voted
against it. Of course, Russia, close friends like Belarus, Syria, North Korea,
Nicaragua. But it also has to be said there are countries and people in Africa
and Asia who resent that other issues, more dangerous for them, they believe.
And like famine, the climate crisis, are not just being eclipsed by this war,
but worsened by it. And the United States is very cognizant. It's not winning
the... it is... it has support, but it's not winning the argument in large parts
of the world, particularly in the south, that it wants to. We've been talking to
Germany's economics and development minister about precisely that, will hear
that interview at 10 to 8. For you, Lise, this is also quite a significant
personal moment back in the Ukrainian capital on the eve of that anniversary
that you and I reported on a year ago tomorrow. How do you find the capital now?
Well, you remember that moment, Nick. No Ukrainian can ever forget that moment,
that moment of disbelief in the early hours of the morning, people being shaken
out of their beds about 4am in the morning, when the bombs started dropping,
when the reports came through that Russian tanks and troops were now rumbling
across the border, that an invasion in our time that many believed right to the
hours before, couldn't, wouldn't, just it wasn't possible it would happen. And a
year on, that shock hasn't dissipated completely. But in the capital Kiev, at
least, and in some of the other major cities, Ukrainians are... I don't want to
say they're finding ways to live with this war, but they are finding ways to
live. There's a curfew, but some shops and restaurants are not just full, but
bustling. There are electricity cuts because of Russian strikes on energy
infrastructure, but Ukrainians are finding a way around it. But Nick, there are
large swathes of this country which are blackened, guttened, ruined. There are
cities like Mariupol, which are now being Russified, where all traces of its
Ukrainian identity and past and memory are being erased. There are huge, huge
losses. You still feel how resolute the Ukrainians are into a person saying that
this is a war they can and will win. I went to some training sessions with young
Ukrainian women and you never knew they'd been through a year of hell. They are
still so determined. And of course, this is a war which is not just about
territory, it is about them. It is against a leader, President Putin, who says
they don't have a right to exist. And in response, they have become even more
Ukrainian. Lise, thank you. Lise is going to be presenting the program from Kyiv
tomorrow morning. 20 minutes to seven. An off-duty police officer is in a
critical but stable condition after being shot at a sports complex in Oma in
County Tyrone. Chris Page, our Ireland correspondent is on the line. Chris,
morning. What more do we know, if anything? Yes, I'm all up. The scene here on
the outskirts of Oma at a complex called Youth Sport. It's here that the officer
was shot around eight o'clock last night. And according to the Police
Federation, the body which represents police officers here, he had been coaching
young people at football here. And it was a very busy complex at the time.
Children, coaches and parents were all on site. So this morning, the main
building and a number of sports pitches are cordoned off. There are several
police officers guarding different entrances. A car with some detectives has
just gone into the scene where forensic searches were carried out last night in
the car park. The police haven't said anything about a potential motive yet, but
it's understood the victim is an officer of senior rank. He is a detective who
has a public profile in Northern Ireland because he's led investigations into
both organised crime, drugs gangs, for example, and into dissident paramilitary
groups who are opposed to the peace process. So it is in those two directions, I
think, where police will be directing their initial inquiries. All right, Chris
Page, Ireland Correspondent. Good to talk to you. Thank you. It is 18 minutes to
seven. Let's take a look at what the morning papers are reporting in London with
you, Amol, but here in Berlin with our Berlin correspondent, Damian McGuinness,
who's still with me. Of course, you cradle the front pages most days in most
countries at the moment. But what in particular is making the front pages the
German papers? Well, today, there's an interesting issue, actually, a local
issue, which taps into a lot of issues that Germany's dealing with right now.
And it's in the town of Lohrach in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in southern Germany, where
tenants of social housing are being moved on to provide housing for refugees.
And that's being commented by lots of papers. The centre-left SÃ¼ddeutsche
Zeitung from Munich says it's not migration policy that's the problem, but
housing policy because of a lack of affordable housing. This could hinder
integration and spark conflict. SÃ¼dkorea from Konstanz says the council is doing
its best. It's not a great solution, but the government needs to be careful and
not play into the hands of far-right anti-refugee extremists. Rhein-Pfalz
Zeitung from Ludwigshafen says the council is not being right-wing or left-wing,
just being heartless. And I think the reason why this is interesting is we've
had more than a million Ukrainian refugees, plus hundreds of thousands of
refugees from elsewhere, migrants and asylum seekers from elsewhere. And the
mood in Germany is very much of acceptance and of having learnt from the
mistakes of 2015. But a big debate on the logistics, housing and infrastructure,
because it is a challenge. Which we'll hear more about after my visit to Tegel
Airport, where all the refugees who arrive here in Berlin are being processed. A
real concern that the numbers arriving now is higher than the refugee crisis of
2016. Real logistical challenges. And I'm going to stick with Ukraine actually,
Nick, because I want to just highlight two absolutely fascinating pieces on
Ukraine that I've seen here in the London media or the UK media. The first is in
the Telegraph Feature section. It's by Dylan Jones, the former editor of GQ
magazine. He's written a rather brilliant analysis of President Zelensky's
sweatshirt, how leaders dress matters a lot, particularly in a time of war. And
of Zelensky's sweatshirt, Dylan Jones writes that it proclaims, I'm with the
army, even though I'm not in the army. I'm a man who gets things done, who does
things instead of says things. I'm a man who doesn't have the time to change
clothes, who doesn't have time to put on a suit. And he compares it to
Churchill's sirens. A rather interesting piece. And the other article I must, I
just must mention is an astonishing, anonymous long read in The Economist's 1843
magazine. It's by a Ukrainian soldier. If you've got 25 minutes at some point
over the next few weeks, it's worth investing them. It's the second part of a
diary the soldier's keeping. It's translated from Ukrainian. And it's just
utterly riveting. And unlike anything, most of us would have read about the war.
Interesting. It's quarter to seven now. Our main news this morning, Labour is
setting out five national missions aimed at helping the party win power and
fixing what it says are some of the deep seated problems facing the UK. We're
going to be speaking to the Labour leader at ten past eight. Now, there's been a
lot of talk about a new deal with the EU, but as yet no sign of it. MPs turned
up for Prime Minister's questions yesterday in Parliament, looking for clues
about Rishi Sunak's plan to fix Brexit. Our correspondent Sean Curran was
watching. As the hands of the clock above the Speaker's chair moved closer to
noon, Rishi Sunak stood waiting to make his entrance. For days, there's been
talk of an imminent announcement about a new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.
But the red folder the Prime Minister was carrying didn't contain a statement
about any agreement. The prospect of new trading arrangements has been the talk
of Westminster this week. But the issue had not been raised in the Commons
Chamber until now. We now come to questions to the Prime Minister. Rishi Sunak
sought to reassure some of his own MPs and members of the DUP, as he told the
Commons the government was still in active discussions with the European Union.
I am a Conservative, a Brexiteer and a Unionist, and any agreement that we reach
needs to tick all three boxes. It needs to ensure sovereignty for Northern
Ireland. It needs to safeguard Northern Ireland's place in our union. And it
needs to find practical solutions to the problems faced by people and
businesses. I will be resolute in fighting for what is best for Northern Ireland
and the United Kingdom. And the Labour leader sought to increase the pressure on
the Prime Minister, as he urged Rishi Sunak to concede that there would have to
be trade-offs in the negotiations, and that in the end, Northern Ireland would
continue to follow some EU law. The Prime Minister is biting his tongue, but at
some point the irreconcilables on his benches are going to twig and they're
going to come after him. The former Trade Minister says there can be no role for
the European Court of Justice in Northern Ireland. So will the Prime Minister be
honest with them and tell them that's not going to happen? Rishi Sunak said the
Labour leader was jumping ahead and talking about a deal he hadn't even seen and
that wasn't finalised. It's his usual position when it comes to the European
Union. It's give the EU a blank cheque and agree to anything they offer. It's
not a strategy, Mr Speaker, that's surrender. Well, that got some Conservatives
cheering, but the former Prime Minister, Theresa May, who was sitting on the
back benches, showed no reaction and looked straight ahead. Rishi Sunak accused
the Labour leader of having previously backed the idea of a second referendum.
All the while he was constantly voting to frustrate Brexit. And I know what the
British people know, that on this question he can't be trusted to stick up for
Britain. Mr Speaker, the sound you hear is them cheering the Prime Minister,
pulling the wool over their eyes. And Sakir Starmer wanted to know what would
happen next. Can the Prime Minister confirm that whatever deal he brings back,
this House will get a vote on it? Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, of course, of
course Parliament will express its view. Had the Prime Minister promised a
Commons vote or something else like a debate? He didn't elaborate further. But
the Labour leader said he took it that MPs would get a vote. In fact, he
suggested they would have already had that vote if it hadn't been for Tory MPs
he described as malcontents, reckless and wreckers. But I'm here to tell him he
doesn't need to worry about that because we will put country before party and
ensure that Labour votes to get it through. He should accept our offer, ignore
the howls of indignation from those on his side who will never take yes for an
answer. Why doesn't he just get on with it? Mr Speaker, Mr Speaker, what I am
doing is talking and listening to the people of Northern Ireland. That is the
right thing to do. It's to make sure that we can respond and resolve to the
concerns of the unionist communities and businesses in Northern Ireland. And
that is what I will keep doing. And Rishi Sunak didn't have to wait long to hear
from the leader of the DUP, Sir Geoffrey Donaldson, who made it clear that he
wanted to see an end to the existing rules. It is unacceptable that EU laws are
imposed on Northern Ireland with no democratic scrutiny or consent. And will he
assure me that he will address these fundamental constitutional issues and do so
not just by tweaking the protocol, but by rewriting the legally binding treaty
text? The Prime Minister didn't offer any details about a potential deal, but he
said he'd heard the DUP leader loud and clear. Sean Curran there reporting on
yesterday in Parliament. You can, as ever, hear more at half past eight on
Digital and Longwave. The time now is ten to seven, ten to eight here in Berlin.
Seitenwende was the word that the German Chancellor used to describe that
historic turning point created by the invasion of Ukraine. It meant moving away
from a belief that dialogue, detente, trade were the routes to a secure, safe
relationship with Russia. Instead, Germany would spend more, much more on
defence. Well, has he, Chancellor Scholz, managed to take the German public with
him? I'm joined in our Berlin studio at the top of a hotel in central Berlin by
Ellen Aini, Editor-in-Chief of WDR TV, which conducts polling for German
television. She's got a regular slot on Germany's equivalent to Newsnight.
Morning to you and thank you very much for coming in. Good morning. Nice place
to be here. What are your polls telling you about how opinion has changed over
this year? Well, it's quite astonishing actually for Germany because, you know,
due to historic reasons, we are very reserved on delivering arms to other
countries. And right before Russia invaded Ukraine, so in February 22, we asked
should Germany deliver arms to Ukraine and only 20% said yes, that's a good
thing to do. One month later, after the invasion of Ukraine, it's like 61%. So
it's increasingly changing the opinion, like, of course, everybody was
completely shocked by the invasion. And so right now, there's a majority saying
that the delivery of arms is a good thing to do. Now, both here in this country
and outside, the Chancellor was mocked for hesitating about whether to send
tanks. You do it first and maybe we will. What does public opinion say about
that decision? Well, we've asked the question since we have one year of war now,
we've asked it all through the months and we said, is it appropriate the
support, the military support that Germany supplies to Ukraine actually? And so
that since that changed every month, you know, first of all, we talked about
helmets, then we talked about artillery, then we talked about main battle tanks,
and we still ask the same question. And the people who think it's adequate, so
what we do is correct, are now 44%. It's not the majority, but it's a relative
majority. And the people who say that this goes too far is one third now, it's
35%. So that's increasing. Now, who are they? And are there many more people
with worries in particular age groups or particular parts of the country? Well,
just concrete to the main battle tank decision, you know, the Leopard that will
be delivered now, we've asked, was that the right decision to deliver it or not?
39% say it was a mistake. So a minority, 52% say it was right. And this is
particularly the case in the East where there are real concerns. Yes, because
when you look at East and West Germany, it's a completely different thing. Like
the majority in the East says it was a mistake. And the majority in the East
says diplomatic efforts to stop this war don't go far enough. And we see for
those who are critical, it's a lot of supporters of the AfD Alternative fÃ¼r
Deutschland, the right wing party, and the left wing party Die Linke. So it's
like the extremes who say this goes too far, but the main public space says it's
good that we did this. Schultz's hesitation has still managed to bring people
with it. And they've gone on that journey with him. Ellen Aney, editor in chief
of WDR television here in Berlin. Thank you. Six minutes to seven. Let's go back
to that fan-led review of football published later today, which tries to address
some of the financial crises that have beset lower league clubs in particular.
Rick Parry is the chair of the English Football League, very first chief
executive of the Premier League when it was launched many, many years ago. Rick,
good morning. Good morning. Just before we get into your thoughts on this white
paper, which I'm very, very keen on, can you spell out as you see it, the crisis
in English football that it's trying to address? I think it's opportunity rather
than crisis from our point of view. Okay. Because in many ways the game's in
rude health, but the problem from our perspective is there's two bigger gulf
between top and bottom. First year of the Premier League, 93. The gap in
turnover between the Premier League and the AFL was 11 million pounds. It's now
3 billion pounds. That's the disparity. It's getting wider all the time. And our
goal, our mission, our purpose is making clubs sustainable, long-term future,
which means not making them wholly dependent upon owner funding. And it means
redistribution of revenues hand in hand with better regulation. So we're
completely in favour of the changes. So I was going to say, to what extent does
this white paper and what you've seen of it answer those worries and provide,
you know, give you the opportunity to fulfil the opportunities that you seek?
Well, it certainly goes a long way. It builds upon the fan-led review, which we
welcomed and embraced, and no surprises. We haven't seen the full white paper
yet, but in terms of the summaries that we've seen, no surprises. A licensing
system, which we think is eminently workable to make sure clubs are solvent. A
better owners and directors test, which is hard to argue against. Backstop
powers for the regulator in the event that football can't solve redistribution.
And based on the evidence of the last 30 years, football cannot solve
redistribution. So we'd far rather have a football-based solution, I have to
say. We'd rather be around the table and negotiating with the Premier League,
but for the regulator to have backstop powers in the event that we can't solve
redistribution. That's really important. Yeah, it's worth noting, of course, as
you will have been very acutely conscious yourself, it's an independent
regulator. I should just clarify, not a government one. Not that you're implying
that. I've got the Sports Minister on around about half past seven. What are
your ongoing concerns about the white paper? What would you like me to ask him?
I think get on with it, because we all need clarity as quickly as possible. He
knows our thoughts. He knows that we don't think that backstop powers on
redistribution are sufficient, because if we don't solve redistribution, what is
the regulator going to do? Is he going to put two thirds of our clubs out of
business, refuse to give them a license when the objective is to keep them
alive? So there is an imbalance there. Minister is acutely aware of our views
because we tell him every time we see him. But yes, if you pass those messages
on again, I'm sure you'll get a wry smile from him. But as I said, for us, it's
a step in the right direction. And let's bring about the changes as soon as we
can. Well, I hope I get an answer as much as a wry smile. Rick Parry, chair of
the English Football League. Really good to talk to you. Thank you. Three
minutes to seven now, Darren Bett. Come join us with the weather morning,
Darren. Good morning again, Nick. We've got quite a difference in the weather at
the moment. North-south across the UK, cold start with some sunshine this
morning for northern areas, but it will be turning cloudy. We've got a cloudy
start further south and it will be turning sunnier. Let's look at the details
across England and Wales. For northern England, it looks like it's going to be a
nice day today. Lots of sunshine around. Any showers pecking north sea coast
will soon move away. We've got more cloud elsewhere across England and Wales.
There's still some patchy rain as well. Everything is moving its way southwards.
The rain tending to die out in the afternoon. It won't be too long before it
becomes dry in Wales and the Midlands. Across to Lincolnshire, we'll see the
sunshine coming out during the morning. Sunny afternoon on the whole. We should
get some sunshine eventually across East Anglia. It could be very late in the
day before the cloud breaks in southern England, but at least it will be turning
much drier during the afternoon. Further north across Northern Ireland, a sunny
start this morning. Chilly start as well. We are going to find more cloud around
in the afternoon, but it should stay dry. In Scotland, we've got the cold start
with a frost in places. There'll be some sunshine which will continue through
the morning across southern and eastern areas, but even here it will cloud over
in the afternoon. The cloud is coming in on a strengthening westerly wind and
that will bring some rain into Northern Scotland, particularly during the
afternoon. And that rain will turn heavier in the Highlands later. The winds
will strengthen as well. For all parts of the UK, it's going to be a cooler day
today. Typical temperatures around 7 to 9 Celsius. Thanks Darren. On BBC
