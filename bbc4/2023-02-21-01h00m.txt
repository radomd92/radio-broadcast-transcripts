 BBC News at midnight. This is Charles Carroll. President Biden has promised to
back Ukraine for as long as it takes on a surprise visit to Kiev. Lancashire
police have confirmed that the body found in a river is that of Nicola Bully,
who went missing more than three weeks ago. An inquest jury has accused police
of a catastrophic failure to protect the five people shot dead in Plymouth by a
man who was allowed to keep a shotgun. Doctors have voted to go on strike in
England in a dispute about pay. Anglican leaders representing three quarters of
the global faithful say they are splitting from the Church of England because of
its decision to bless same-sex partnerships. Also tonight, a potential
breakthrough in the treatment of stroke patients and why fruit and veg are
missing from supermarket shelves. President Biden has pledged his unwavering
support for Ukraine on a surprise visit to Kiev just days before the anniversary
of Russia's invasion. He arrived in the capital this morning after a 10-hour
train journey from Poland. President Zelensky then accompanied him on a walk
through the city's streets before a joint press conference where Mr Biden
announced more military, political and financial support for Ukraine and tougher
sanctions against Moscow. Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev said that
the visit could only have happened because his country provided safety
guarantees to President Biden. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen has sent
this report from Kiev. The sirens wailed as the two presidents walked out into
Kiev's bright winter sun under the blue walls and golden domes of St Michael's
Church. The timing felt too precise for the alarm to be a coincidence though
there was some Russian air activity far away in Belarus. The two men stayed in
the open air to lay wreaths at Ukraine's memorial for war dead. A point was
being made. Ukraine was still under attack and the leader of the world's most
powerful country, the United States, had come to an active war zone to show
support for his ally. President Volodymyr Zelensky. President Biden arrived here
by train like all the other leaders who visited Kiev. The Americans warned the
Russians at the weekend that the visit was happening but tried to keep it secret
at home. Before they were driven to St Michael's, President Zelensky welcomed
his guest at a brief ceremony at his official residence. Thank you very much for
coming Mr President. It's a huge moment of support for the Ukraine and what can
I say? He said President Biden was visiting at the most difficult time for
Ukraine. President Biden responded with strong words of support. You and all
Ukrainians remind the world every single day what the meaning of the word
courage is. Remind us that freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for for as
long as it takes and that's how long we're going to be with you Mr President for
as long as it takes. With the spring fighting season in sight, the war is
delicately balanced. In eastern Ukraine, Russia has started a new offensive and
President Vladimir Putin is due to make his own big speech about the war
tomorrow. Russia has mobilized several hundred thousand new conscripts and
despite heavy casualties and huge losses of equipment, the Russian war effort
grinds on. The hard reality of Russian aggression has forced NATO leaders,
especially Joe Biden, to make some tough decisions. The biggest so far might
come soon. Ukraine is pushing the Americans and other western allies for more
powerful weapons including modern war planes as well as continuing shipments to
replace the huge amounts of shells and rockets it's expended. It wants to win,
to drive Russia out, not just hold its own in a long war of attrition. The
Ukrainians want a decisive upgrade as soon as possible. Time might not be their
friend. President Putin seems to believe that Russia can tough it out longer
than the west. President Zelensky wants to be able to act before voices in NATO
calling for negotiation and a peace deal that hands Russia territory get any
louder. As President Biden visited Kiev, fierce fighting was continuing on the
front lines in the east of Ukraine. Russian forces are stepping up their assault
on Bakhmut, which they've been trying to capture for more than six months and
where they've made advances in recent days. Our senior international
correspondent Oleg Herin sent this report from the outskirts of the city. The
battle for Bakhmut is now at close quarters inside the city and on the
outskirts. Ukrainian troops are still defending every inch, but the enemy is
closing in. It's hellish according to President Zelensky who says Bakhmut must
be defended but not at any cost. We joined a Ukrainian mortar team on the
outskirts, keeping the Russians at bay on their section of the front line. A
soldier called Victor tells us Russia will always be a problem. He says the
troops are fighting so their children won't have to. My eldest son will have to
finish what we don't, he says. I don't want this. None of the soldiers who have
sons and daughters want this. We want to end the war here and now. But with
Russian forces gaining more ground, Ukraine may have to give up the fight in
Bakhmut to save lives and resources for battles elsewhere. President Biden's
trip was cloaked in secrecy, only a handful of his closest advisors in the US
knew it was happening, as our Washington correspondent Nomiya Iqbal explains.
For weeks, White House officials had been saying a trip to Kiev was not on the
cards. President Biden's security adviser even denied the possibility over the
weekend. But there had always been an expectation he would make an appearance.
He and his Democratic party want this to be seen as a great presidential moment
of global leadership and strength. His visit does not change the US's policy of
supporting Ukraine's freedom, but does demonstrate his commitment to see that
policy succeed. It's a trip that sends a strong message to Moscow, but also to
China, which has been accused of supporting Putin. Mr Biden's words that the
United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, continue to be
fully in line with public opinion here. But there is some resistance among
Republican politicians who are increasingly opposing continued aid to Ukraine.
Our World Affairs editor, John Simpson, is in Kyiv. He assesses the timing of Mr
Biden's visit and the message it sends to Moscow. As a move on the geopolitical
chessboard, the visit comes at a highly critical moment. Vladimir Putin is to
make a major statement tomorrow about the future of the war. And China's top
diplomat has just arrived in Moscow at a time when the Americans are warning
that China's thinking of supplying Russia with weapons. For his part, Ukraine's
President Zelensky is in an optimistic mood. He told me the other day that
Ukraine just had to hold on until it could launch its own counter offensive. But
the EU's Foreign Affairs Chief, Josep Borrell, gave a stark warning yesterday
that unless Europe supplied a Ukraine with more weapons, the war would be lost.
So President Biden's appearance in Kyiv couldn't have happened at a more
dramatic time. It was a rallying cry to the West, a warning to Russia and China,
and above all, a binding assurance to Ukraine that the US wouldn't let it be
defeated. Diplomats with long memories are already comparing it to President
Kennedy's speech at the Berlin Wall in 1961. Liz Truss and Boris Johnson have
added to the pressure on Rishi Sunak to help Ukraine by sending fighter jets.
The two conservative former prime ministers made the plea as they spoke at
length in the House of Commons during a general debate on Ukraine. It was Ms
Truss's first contribution as a backbench MP since 2012 when she became a
minister. Lancashire police have confirmed that a body found on a stretch of the
river wire yesterday is that of Nicola Bully. The 45-year-old went missing more
than three weeks ago while walking her dog in the village of St Michael's on
Wire. In a statement, Ms Bully's family said they would never be able to
comprehend what had gone through, what she had gone through in her final
moments. Nick Garnett reports from Preston. The news, nobody wanted to hear. The
body found in the river wire less than a mile from where she was last seen was
Nicola Bully. Lancashire police's assistant chief constable Peter Lawson spoke
to reporters outside the forces headquarters in Preston. Sadly, we are now able
to confirm that yesterday we recovered Nicola Bully from the river wire.
Nicola's family have been informed and are of course devastated. Our thoughts
are with them at this time as well as with all her loved ones and the wider
community. Detective Superintendent Pauline Stables read a statement on behalf
of Ms Bully's partner Paul Ansel and their daughters. We will never be able to
comprehend what Nicky had gone through in her last moments and that will never
leave us. We will never forget Nicky, how could we? She was the centre of our
world. She was the one who made our lives so special and nothing will cast a
shadow over that. Last week police revealed their class Ms Bully as a high risk
missing person. They highlighted alcohol as a factor as well as medical
information about her. That information was released with the knowledge of the
family and in an effort to explain the specific vulnerabilities police were
referring to. But the actions were condemned as victim blaming. An internal
investigation into the decision is being carried out. The Home Secretary, Soella
Breverman raised concerns with the chief constable about the release of those
details. Today she said she hadn't been wholly satisfied by his reply.
Lancashire police have said throughout they had two priorities for this
investigation to provide answers for the family of Nicola Bully and to bring her
home to her loved ones. The family have asked for their privacy to be respected.
An inquest jury has said there was a catastrophic failure in the firearms
licensing unit at Devon and Cornwall police before the gunman Jake Davison
unlawfully killed four adults and a child in Plymouth in August 2021. Davison,
who was 22, shot them with a legally owned gun in the Keam area of the city
before killing himself. The families of the victims said today that the decision
to allow him to own a shotgun despite a history of mental health issues and
violence meant that he had been granted a license to kill. Our West of England
correspondent Jenny Kumar reports from the inquest. Jake Davison killed his
mother at their home on August 12, 2021 after a row. He went on to fatally shoot
four people at random, including a three-year-old girl. The jury concluded that
there were serious failings by police and they should not have granted the
gunman a license in 2018 because of a lack of medical information, his self-
declared autism and his history of violence. They also found there was an unsafe
culture in the firearms licensing unit and staff when adequately trained. A
decision to return the gun and license after police removed it in 2020 because
Davison had assaulted two children was described as fundamentally flawed. The
fatal shootings happened weeks after police gave the gun back in July 2021.
Patrick Maguire, the solicitor representing the families, gave a statement
outside court. The system has hopelessly failed us. In particular, the Devon and
Cornwall police force has failed us. They have failed to protect our loved ones.
Warning signs were ignored and a license to kill was granted. The Chief
Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police Will Curr said lessons will be learnt. On
behalf of Devon and Cornwall police I am deeply sorry for the loss of those
families and for the feelings in my force that led to Jake Davison having a gun
where he shouldn't have. The families of those who died say they want to see
seismic changes in the licensing system so no one else has to endure the torment
they have. Junior doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly to go on strike
over pay. The British Medical Association, the union that represents them, says
almost everyone who cast a ballot agreed to industrial action. The union is now
planning a three-day walkout next month. The health secretary, Steve Barclay,
said the announcement on the day thousands of ambulance staff went on strike
again in England and Wales was deeply disappointing. Here's our health
correspondent Sophie Hutchinson. This is a significant escalation in the
industrial action in the NHS. So-called junior doctors make up just over 40% of
all doctors in England. In fact, most medics below the level of consultant.
47,000 were balloted to strike and the majority agreed. Their union, the British
Medical Association, is now planning a three-day walkout, the longest single
strike in their history. It's likely to hit the NHS hard, heaping pressure on
the government. The doctors now join nurses who've staged six individual strikes
and ambulance crews who walked out again today in some parts of England and
Wales. All are calling for above-inflation pay increases. The doctors say they
want to restore pay in real terms to 2008 levels, which would mean a 26% pay
rise. The BMA has accused the government of recklessness, saying ministers have
refused to enter meaningful negotiations. The government says it's met the BMA
to discuss pay and conditions, but that pay in line with inflation is
unaffordable, and that the industrial action will mean more cancelled
appointments for patients. A group of conservative Anglican church leaders from
around the world have said that they will refuse to recognise the Archbishop of
Canterbury as the head of the global Anglican Communion. The announcement
follows the Church of England's decision to allow prayers of blessing for same-
sex couples. Harry Farley reports. This is the first time that the Archbishop of
Canterbury's leadership has been rejected by such a large group of senior
Anglicans. The statement is signed by the heads of 10 out of 42 provinces in the
worldwide Anglican Communion. They say they no longer consider Justin Welby to
be leader of the global Communion, and they have disqualified the Church of
England from being their mother church. Archbishop Welby said earlier this month
he would not cling to his role as head of the Communion after he led the Church
of England to allowing prayers of blessing for same-sex couples. A statement
from Lambeth Palace said any formal change would need to be agreed by the other
bodies that lead the Communion. Unlike the Catholic Church, as head of the
Communion, Justin Welby doesn't have any formal authority over other Anglicans
around the world. So this rejection by Conservative archbishops is largely
symbolic of the divisions that already exist within the global Anglican Church.
Two further earthquakes have hit south-eastern Turkey near the border with
Syria. Officials said the larger of the tremors near the city of Antakya had a
magnitude of 6.4. At least three people were killed and more than 200 injured.
The earthquakes earlier this month killed more than 46,000 people. Reporting
from Antakya, our correspondent Laura Bicker. There is fear, some panic and the
small aftershocks keep coming. Lines of ambulances and rescue crews are trying
to get to some of the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged
buildings have collapsed. A number of structures that were left standing after
the tremor on February 6th have now crumbled, including a bridge. The Hatay
mayor has said that there are people trapped under the rubble. Many cracks and
roads have become deep scars, making it more difficult for the emergency
services to get where they may be needed. Researchers in the United States say
they've partially restored movement in the arms and hands of two people who've
had a stroke. One volunteer was able to cut and eat a steak by herself for the
first time in nine years. However, more research is still needed to develop the
technology and to determine exactly who will benefit. Here's our health and
science correspondent James Gallagher. Strokes disrupt the blood supply in the
brain and lead to cells dying. People can still have the desire and intent to
move, but the damage means the instructions from the brain can become so weak
that nothing happens. Heather Rendelek from Pittsburgh had a stroke when she was
still in her 20s. She learned how to walk again, but for nine years she was
unable to open or close her left hand. In the experiment, she had electrodes
implanted in her neck to stimulate and excite the nerves. Now, they could
respond to even the weak instructions from the brain that were still getting
through. As soon as the device was switched on, Heather noticed the difference.
So the very first day I came into the lab and they turned the stimulation on for
the first time, I actually was able to open my hand for the first time in nine
years and my family and I were in tears of just overwhelming joy and happiness
and it was an amazing experience. Heather was one of two people to take part in
the experiments which have been published in Nature Medicine. Dr Marco
Capagrosso from the University of Pittsburgh says the results show there is the
potential to have a huge impact on people's lives. Our patients recover but they
don't become completely normal. So now they can actually use their arm, even if
not perfectly. That means that they can recover a lot of independence and a lot
of quality of life just because they can use their arm and hand now, even though
they probably cannot play the piano. The team believe the field could advance
quickly as they're using technologies that are already approved for managing
severe pain. But for now, it will take more clinical trials to work out who
benefits and how to move the equipment from the laboratory to the home. The
British Retail Consortium has explained why some fruit and vegetables have
disappeared from supermarket shelves. A spell of poor weather in parts of Europe
and North Africa has disrupted supplies, especially of tomatoes. Here's our
business correspondent Theo Leggett. Pictures of empty shelves in supermarkets
and complaints about shortages of some products, especially tomatoes, have been
circulating on social media for several days. Now the British Retail Consortium
has admitted that harvests have been affected by what it calls difficult weather
conditions. During the winter months, a large proportion of the produce we
consume is grown in southern Spain and Morocco. Both regions have been affected
by poor weather in recent weeks, including storms and a cold snap. This has
affected crop yields and growing times, making it more difficult for wholesalers
and retailers to get hold of the supplies they need. Along with tomatoes,
cucumbers and peppers are understood to be in short supply. The BRC says
supermarkets are working with farmers to ensure customers are able to access a
wide range of fresh produce. Rishi Sunak has condemned the rewriting of Roald
Dahl's books, saying that they should not be airbrushed. Dahl's works, which
include the BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have had references to
things like character's appearance and weight changed. The Roald Dahl Story
Company and the publisher Puffin Books said that they had been updated to be
more suitable for modern audiences. Our media and arts correspondent David
Silato takes up the story. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a much-loved
children's story. Millions have read about Augustus Gloop, who was in the book a
nine-year-old boy who was so enormously fat, he looked as though he'd been blown
up with a powerful pump. However, in the latest version he's so enormous, he
looked as though he'd been blown up with a powerful pump. The word fat has gone.
In Fantastic Mr Fox, the tractor's colour black has been removed. They're now
just murderous, brutal-looking monsters. And these are just a few of the changes
that have been made to Roald Dahl's books to make them less judgmental. The
author Salman Rushdie says it's absurd censorship. A view shared by the
philosopher Kathleen Stock. We don't seem to think children can cope with words
like fat anymore. We need to teach them the words don't have to hurt them rather
than telling them that they do hurt them and we're going to protect them from
them. The Roald Dahl story company said today it's not unusual to review the
language of books and said they had maintained the irreverence and sharp-edged
spirit of the original text. This isn't the first time children's writers have
been updated. Roald Dahl did it himself. Kareen Lesnik-Obistine, Professor of
Children's Literature from the University of Reading. Even back in the 1970s
there were already discussions around his texts and for instance the Oompa
Loompas which were originally from Africa were already changed much earlier and
I was interested that the discussion has mostly been about the changes that are
taking place currently. And while this has provoked a degree of fury, it's also
worth noting the Dahl estate has just done a huge deal with Netflix. Adding a
bit of extra sensitivity to the books can be very helpful business-wise.
Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has become the third candidate to take
over the take over the leadership of the SNP after Nicola Sturgeon's surprise
resignation announcement last week. Ms Forbes joins Absayyusif, the Health
Secretary and Ash Regan, a former Minister, in the contest which is likely to be
dominated by the issue of independence and a row over trans rights. Here's our
Scotland correspondent James Shaw. These three candidates represent a
generational shift for the SNP. All are under 50 and have forged their careers
while the party has been in power in Scotland. Kate Forbes, the 32-year-old
Finance Secretary, is promising competent leadership and a broadly based
campaign to deliver independence. On gender recognition reform, Ms Forbes, who's
a member of the socially conservative Free Church of Scotland, says she would
not have voted for the bill but isn't against reform as such. She says the
concerns raised by the UK government about its impact on equality law need to be
dealt with. I have never been averse to reform of the Gender Recognition Act and
so I think we do need to reform it to make it less onerous but in so doing we
need to look at the amendments that would make it compatible. The candidate most
likely to be seen as continuing Nicola Sturgeon's policy agenda is the Health
Secretary, Humsa Yousuf, Mr Yousuf who's 37 has more ministerial experience but
opposition parties have criticised his handling of Covid recovery and winter
pressures in the health service. He said he is not as firmly committed as Nicola
Sturgeon to the idea of using the next general election as in effect a
referendum on independence. Mr Yousuf suggests the SNP needs to build support
for independence before seeking another vote. Let's be realistic, let's achieve
independence by making sure it's a settled well of the Scottish people. If it
becomes a settled well then becomes impossible for politicians and Westernists
to ignore. Ash Regan resigned as a minister in the Scottish Government because
of her opposition to gender recognition reform. She has suggested she supports
the idea of campaigning for the next election as an independence referendum. The
former head of the government's national food strategy has welcomed plans by the
Mayor of London to give all primary school children free meals. Henry Dimbleby
said the scheme, which is funded for one year from September, should be extended
across England. Here's our education reporter Vanessa Clark. It's estimated
there are 800,000 children across England living in poverty who don't receive
free school meals. Only children in their first three years of primary school as
well as those in families earning less than 7,400 pounds are eligible. But in
London from September every primary school child will receive a free school
meal, a plan which its mayor Sidique Khan says is vital. It leads to a situation
where you haven't got parents skipping meals to their kids can eat. Some of the
stories I've heard are heartbreaking of children without a pack of lunch not
receiving free school meals pretending to have lunch so they're not embarrassed
in front of other children. Mr Khan, who is up for re-election next year, says
he is able to fund this scheme because of higher than expected council tax and
business rate returns. But there are concerns that it's only for a year and it
excludes secondary school pupils. In Wales all primary school children will be
given free lunches by 2024. The former head of the government's national food
strategy, Henry Dimbleby, told the Today programme the scheme should be extended
across England. There are a lot of people who just don't like the idea of
universal benefits even though these are proven to work not just on an
ideological basis but most for those children who are already on free school
meals. So it's ideology that's stopping this and what's great about this is that
it should make the case irrefutable to roll this out. The Department for
Education says more than a third of pupils in England now receive free school
meals. In the city the 100 share index ended the day up 10 points at 8,014. On
Wall Street the Dow Jones was closed today for a public holiday. On the currency
markets the pound is trading at $1.20.3 and against the euro sterling is at 1
euro 12.6 which makes a euro worth 88.8 pence. Now a first look at the morning
papers. A number of the front pages this morning feature Nicola Bully after
police confirmed that her body has been found. The headlines in The Sun, The
Daily Express and The Daily Mail quote her family's statements saying that she
can rest now. According to The Times Rishi Sunak has been told that some members
of his government are prepared to resign if a deal he's trying to reach with the
EU risks Northern Ireland's place within the UK. The paper says the Prime
Minister spent several hours yesterday meeting Eurosceptic Conservative MPs
trying to address their concerns about a new agreement on post-Brexit trade
arrangements. And several papers lead on President Biden's surprise trip to
Kiev. The Guardian's correspondent describes the visit as arguably the most
consequential made by a US president to a European country since the end of the
Cold War. A vast collection of precious artifacts stolen from Cambodia decades
ago have been returned to the country after surfacing in London. The crowns,
necklaces, amulets and other treasures from the Angkor period are many centuries
old. Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton has been following the story. Young
Cambodian archaeologists have been in London marvelling over the collection. The
77 items including crowns, earrings and a large bowl that's thought to be solid
gold can be matched to stone carvings on the walls of the Angkor Wat temple
complex that dates to the 12th century. They were in the possession of a known
antiquities smuggler, a British man named Douglas Latchford. He died while
awaiting trial in the US in 2020. The Latchford family had promised to return
his stolen collection to Cambodia, but the authorities didn't know what they'd
receive. As the head of the country's antiquities investigations team Brad
Gordon explains, they certainly didn't expect it to be abruptly handed over in a
car park last summer. There was a vehicle, the door was open and inside were
four boxes of Cambodia's greatest treasures. I felt like crying. I just thought
wow, the crown jewels of the Cambodian ancient civilization had ended up here in
the UK and it was all packed up in four boxes in the back of a car. The return
of the looted jewelry will be portrayed as a victory for Cambodia's
authoritarian leader Hun Sen ahead of parliamentary elections this summer.
Politics aside, this unexpected event is being celebrated in Phnom Penh. After
decades hidden in a London warehouse, these treasures will soon go on display,
ready to shine once again. Our main headline again, President Biden has promised
to back Ukraine for as long as it takes on a surprise visit to Kiev. BBC News.
Read tonight by Charles Carroll. Now for a look at the weather, here's Louise
Lear. Good morning. We started Monday on a windy note with gales across the
country but closed the afternoon on a mild note. In fact temperatures across
East Anglia 17 Celsius by the middle of the afternoon way above where they
should be for this time of year. This mild theme is set to continue for today
but we will start to see and feel a change as we move into Wednesday. But let's
take a look at Tuesday's weather in a little more detail. A cloudy grey start
first thing in the morning, a very mild start. The cloud thick enough out
towards West facing coast for a little bit of light patchy rain and drizzle. And
there'll be more nuisance rain moving across the western isles drifting north
into the northern isles as we go through the morning. Not as windy here as
Monday but nevertheless still quite a blustery start to the day. We keep the
cloud for most of the afternoon but generally across the country there will be a
few holes in the cloud. East and Scotland, Eastern England favoured spots for
that to happen and therefore temperatures will start to climb 13 or 14 Celsius
not out of the question. So not a bad day on Tuesday but the change will come
through Wednesday. There's a cold front that's going to sink its way south from
the northwest and it's going to introduce slightly cooler, fresher conditions as
it does so. So as we go into the early hours of Wednesday morning we'll start to
see some showery rain moving in from the northwest. That'll be across the
Midlands first thing in the morning, sinking southeast towards the London area
as we head towards the latter stages of Wednesday morning. Behind it though
quite a clearance. Sunny spells coming through, a few scattered showers driven
on by some fresh northwesterly winds and some of the showers in the far north of
Scotland across the mountains could turn a little more wintry. So top
temperatures by the time we get to Wednesday of 6 to 8 Celsius in Scotland and
Northern Ireland 8 to 11 Celsius across England and Wales. That's it. Enjoy your
Tuesday. Now I'm ready for it's time for our Book of the Week. Blake Ritson
reads Super Infinite The Transformations of John Dunn by Catherine Rundle. The
Power of John Dunn's Words Nearly Killed a Man It was the late spring of 1623 on
the morning of Ascension Day and Dunn had finally secured for himself celebrity,
fortune and a captive audience. He had been appointed the Dean of St Paul's
Cathedral two years before. He was 51, slim and amply bearded and his preaching
was famous across the whole of London. His congregation, merchants, aristocrats,
actors in elaborate ruffs, the whole sweep of the city, came to his sermons
carrying paper and ink, wrote down his finest passages and took them home to
dissect and relish, pontificate and argue over. He often wept in the pulpit, in
joy and in sorrow, and his audience would weep with him. That morning he was
preaching at Lincoln's Inn. Word went out and people came flocking to hear him
speak. That morning, too many people. There was a great concourse of noblemen
and gentlemen, and in among the extreme press and thronging as they pushed
closer to hear his words, men in the crowd were shoved to the ground and
trampled. Two or three were endangered and taken up dead for the time. There's
no record of Don halting his sermon, so it's likely that he kept going in his
rich, authoritative voice as the bruised men were carried off and out of sight.
A quarter of a century before that, the same man, then about 23 years old, sat
for a portrait. He wore a hat big enough to sail a cat in, a big lace collar, an
exquisite moustache. Here was the author of some of the most celebratory and
most lavishly sexed poetry ever written in English, shared among an intimate and
loyal group of hyper-educated friends. License my roving hands and let them go
behind before above between below. O my America, my new-found land, my kingdom,
safest when with one man manned. Sometime religious outsider and social
disaster, sometime celebrity preacher and establishment darling, John Donne was
incapable of being just one thing. He reimagined and reinvented himself over and
over. He was a poet, lover, essayist, lawyer, pirate, ricizant, preacher,
satirist, politician, courtier, chaplain to the king, dean of the finest
cathedral in London. There are few writers of his time who faced greater horror.
Donne's family history was one of blood and fire. A great uncle was arrested in
an anti-Catholic raid and executed. Another was locked inside the Tower of
London where, as a small schoolboy, Donne visited him, venturing fearfully in
among the men convicted to death. As a student, a young priest whom his brother
had tried to shelter was captured, hanged, drawn and quartered. His brother was
taken by the priest hunters at the same time, tortured and locked in a plague-
ridden jail. At sea, Donne watched in horror and fascination as dozens of
sailors burnt to death. He married a young woman and more clandestine and
hurried by love and, as a result, found himself thrown in prison. Once married,
they were often poor and at the mercy of richer friends and relations. He knew
what it was to be jealous and thwarted and bitter. He was wrapped by life-
threatening illnesses with dozens of bouts of fever. At least three times, it
was believed he was dying. He lost over the course of his life six children. He
lost Anne at the age of 33, her body destroyed by bearing 12 children. He
thought often of sin and miserable failure and suicide. He believed us unique in
our capacity to ruin ourselves. He wrote, Nothing but man, of all invenomed
things, doth work upon itself with inborn sting. He was a man who walked so
often in darkness that it became for him a daily commute. But there are also few
writers of his time who insisted so doggedly and determinedly on awe. His poetry
is wildly delighted and captivated by the body, though broken, though doomed to
decay, and by the ways in which thinking fast and hard were a sensual joy akin
to sex. He kicked aside the Petrarchan traditions of idealised, sanitised
desire. He joyfully brought the body to collide with the soul. In his sermons,
he reckoned us a disaster, but the most spectacular disaster that has ever been.
As he got older, he grew richer, harsher, sterner, and drier, yet he still
asserted, It is too little to call man a little world. Except God, man is a
diminutive to nothing. Man consists of more pieces, more parts than the world
doth, nay, than the world is. Joy and squalor. Both Dunn's life and work tell
that it is fundamentally impossible to have one without taking up the other.
Dunn, sore, analysed, lived alongside even saluted corruption and death. He was
often hopeless, often despairing, and yet still he insisted at the very end, It
is an astonishment to be alive, and it behoves you to be astonished. You cannot
claim a man is an alchemist and fail to lay out the gold. This, then, is an
undated poem, probably written for Anne Moore, sometime in his twenties, known
as Love's Growth. I scarce believe my love to be so pure as I had thought it
was, because it doth endure vicissitude and season as the grass. He thinks I
lied all winter when I swore my love was infinite, if spring make it more. But
if this medicine, love, which cures all sorrow with more, not only be no
quintessence, but mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense, and of the sun is
working vigour borrow, loves not so pure an abstract as they used to say, which
have no mistress but their muse. But, as all else being elemented too, love
sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do. Read the opening stanza, and all the
oxygen in a five-mile radius rushes to greet you. It's a poem with gleeful
tricks and puns in it. But if this medicine, love, which cures all sorrow with
more, is a small private gift for Anne Moore, no matter how many millions of
other people have read it since, the poem was different for her. Love, he
writes, is a mixture of elemental things, as all else being elemented too, and
so love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do. Done is more daring than he
sounds. The thirteenth-century theologian Thomas Aquinas' ideal was the mixed
life, one of contemplation and action. Done hijacks the Aquinian ideal for his
own erotic purpose. The do is sex. It's the same impulse as in another poem, the
ecstasy, where bodies must join as well as minds, else a great prince in prison
lies. True sex, he insists, is so played out in flesh. Love's growth hangs on
the idea of apparently infinite love, made more. Which, once you have read all
that he wrote, is wholly unsurprising. John Donne was an infinity merchant. The
word is everywhere in his work, more than infinity, super infinity. In a sermon,
he wrote of how he would one day be with God in an infinite, a super infinite,
an unimaginable space, millions of millions of unimaginable spaces in heaven. He
loved to coin formations with the super prefix, super edifications, super
exaltations, super dying, super universal, super miraculous. It was part of his
bid to invent a language that would reach beyond language, because infinite
wasn't enough. Both in heaven, but also here and now on earth, Donne wanted to
know something larger than infinity. That version of Donne, an excessive,
hungry, longing, is everywhere in the love poetry. Sometimes it was worn
lightly, who has yet written about nudity with more glee, more jokes. In To His
Mistress Going to Bed, written in his twenties, the speaker attempts to coax his
lover out of her clothes. Full nakedness, all joys are due to thee, as soul's
unbodied bodies unclothed must be to taste whole joys. The poem could be seen as
one of domineering masculinity, except that at the end of it, there's a joke.
Only the man stands naked. Then there is the wilder, defiantly odd Donne,
typified by the poem for which most people know him, the flea. The speaker
watches a flea crawl over the body of the woman he desires. Mark but this flea,
and mark in this how little that which thou denis'd me is. Me it sucked first,
and now sucks thee, and in this flea are two bloods mingled be. When the poem
was first printed in 1633, the typographers used the long s, a letter that looks
almost identical to an f, for the words sucked and suck, which offers readers of
the third line another more extravagant rendering. Donne does not in his love
poetry insist on sweetness. He does not play the my lady is a perfect dove game,
beloved by those who came before him. What good is perfection to humans? It's a
dead thing. The urgent, the bold, the witty, the sharp, all better than
perfection. He took his galvanising imagination and brought it to bear on
everything he wrote, his sermons, his meditations, his religious verse. In the
21st century, Donne's imagination offers us a form of body armour. His work is
protection against the slipshod and the half-baked, against anti-
intellectualism, against those who try to sell you their money-ridden vision of
sex and love. He is protection against those who would tell you to narrow
yourself, to follow fashion in your mode of thought. It's not that he was a
rebel, it's that he was a pure original. They do us a service, the true
uncompromising originals. They show us what is possible. To tell the story of
Donne's life is to ask a question. How did he, possessed of a strange and
labyrinthical mind, navigate the corresponding social and political labyrinths
of Renaissance England? What did his imagination look like when he was young,
and how was it battered and burnished as he grew older? Did it protect him from
sorrow and fury and resentment? To spoil the suspense, it did not. Did it allow
him to write out the human problem in a way that we, following on 400 years
later, can still find urgent truth in? It did. Dark texts, he wrote to a friend,
need notes. And it is possible to see his whole body of work as offering us a
note on ourselves. How John Donne saw us with such clarity and how he set down
what he knew with such precision and flair that we can seize hold of it and
carry it with us. He knew about Dred, and it is therefore that we can trust him
when he tells us of its opposite, of ravishments and of love. Super Infinite by
