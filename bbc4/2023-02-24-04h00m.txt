 who was a child living under Japanese occupation. This is the BBC World
Service, the world's radio station. Coming up on Outlook, the children's TV star
who found herself on China's most wanted list. Gulchek Rahodja was a popular
face on television in the 1990s, the star of the first Uyghur language kids'
show in China. Everybody can recognise me when I was in the street, everywhere.
They will approach me, oh, Gulchek Rahodja, you are part of our childhood. It
makes me so happy and proud. But the Chinese authorities began a crackdown on
Uyghur culture and Gul had to tow the party line. She felt her TV show was being
used to promote government policies that were making life hard for her people.
That moment, I feel I betrayed my people, betrayed those kids who love me and
trust me. I feel guilty. Gul found a way out, but it would mean saying goodbye
to her family, possibly forever, and it would make her an enemy of the state.
Her story on Outlook after the news. 7 countries opposed the resolution, 32
others abstained, including China and India, but the British ambassador to the
UN, Barbara Woodward, said abstaining was a bold move for some countries. I
think it's worth bearing in mind that Russia, a bit like it has in Ukraine, is a
bully when it comes to UN votes. And so it intimidates countries and it makes
very clear that an abstention counts as a vote against Russia. So that's a
pretty brave thing for some countries where Russia is closely involved,
economically or militarily, to do, even to put down an abstention. Poland has
started fortifying its border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Warsaw
says there's been a rise in flights into Kaliningrad from Turkey and the Middle
East, it fears migrants arriving there, will be encouraged by Moscow to cross
into the European Union. North Korea has test fired four strategic cruise
missiles into the sea. The state news agency said the drill demonstrated the
readiness of what it called Pyongyang's nuclear combat force. It's the latest in
a series of weapons tests. A court in Los Angeles has sentenced the former
Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein to a further 16 years in jail for rape and
sexual assault. The offence is date back 10 years. Weinstein is already serving
a 23-year sentence after a separate conviction in New York. Sophie Long reports
now from Los Angeles. Harvey Weinstein's victim tearfully told the court how
she'd carried the trauma of what he did to her for years, that she'd been a
happy, confident woman who valued herself before he brutally assaulted her in
2013. She said no prison sentence could erase the damage, but the maximum term
would restore faith in the justice system among victims. Harvey Weinstein
responded and said, I maintain my innocence. I do not know her. She does not
know me. At 70 and in ill health, the man who lived life in the luxury Beverly
Hills hotels, where he committed some of his crimes, will likely die in prison.
This is the latest world news from the BBC. The government of Madagascar says a
powerful storm which batchered the east coast of the island is now known to have
killed at least seven people. Cyclone Freddie brought torrential rain and strong
winds. The storm is now heading towards Mozambique. It's expected to make
landfall in the coming hours. A senior federal investigator in the United States
has called for an end to the politicisation of a rail disaster in Ohio. Jennifer
Homandy was announcing the findings of a preliminary report into the crash which
caused a major chemical spill three weeks ago. She said there was no indication
that the train's crew did anything wrong, but described the derailment as
entirely preventable. Peru's government has declared a state of emergency in
more than a dozen areas because of an outbreak of dengue fever. So far this
year, the illness has killed 16 people. Dengue fever is transmitted by
mosquitoes and is often found in tropical areas. A Russian Soyuz capsule has
lifted off from Kazakhstan to bring back three men stranded on the International
Space Station, it'll be some time before the two Russian cosmonauts and an
American colleague return to Earth, as Rory Gallemore now reports. Missions on
the International Space Station usually last six months. By the time these three
men are scheduled to leave in September, they'll have spent a full year in
orbit. That wasn't the original plan. A capsule already attached to the ISS was
supposed to make the return journey, but it began leaking coolant late last
year. Liquid particles were seen spraying into the blackness, forcing the
cancellation of a spacewalk. The new capsule is carrying supplies, although
there's no replacement crew on board. Last month, a NASA spokesman said the men
were willing to extend their stay, but he joked a delivery of ice cream might be
needed as a reward. When they switched it on, they soon had company. to our home
and watch together. We don't really watch what's going on, we are just happy to
see them, you know. We were like, just spend time together. It was a happiness
for all of us. Yeah. And I feel like wow, TV's very special things, you know.
And I was dreaming about I'm going to dance in that TV, I'm going to sing on
that TV like that. but I never have a dream to speak on the TV. So you wanted to
be a singer and dancer. Yeah. That was your plan. Yeah. My very young age, my
dream was being a star. Whatever is it, being a star, you know. Gulchekra Ghul
for short did become a star, a famous presenter of the first ever Uighur
Children's TV show. The Uighur are a minority in China, culturally and racially
distinct, with their own language and history. They are Muslim. And this kids'
programme that Gul devised was designed to teach them about their society. It
made her madly popular. A few years later, life took a dramatic turn and now Gul
lives in exile, her name on China's most wanted list. We spoke on video link
from her home in the United States, with her husband and three children
surrounded by memories of her family back in Aromche, the capital of Xinjiang
province. Gul's grandfather, the one with the TV, was revered in his community
as a composer of mukham, traditional Uighur music. You can play 24 hours
nonstoply. It's like life, a celebrating life. It makes you dance, makes you
cry, makes you laugh. We play all those music, even from our mum's womb. We
start hearing those music. And it's in our blood, actually. And fortunately, I
was born in Mukhammester home. Your grandfather? My grandpa, Zikri Al Peta, is
one of the composers who wrote so many Uighur music. So I grew up with this.
That's why I feel like music inside of my blood. You had an unusual access,
didn't you, to your traditional culture? Because as you mentioned, your
grandfather was a Mukham-Marskesser. Your father, an archaeologist, who knew all
about the history and so on. What would he teach you about what it is to be
Uighur? About the cyclic road, about what is under the Teklemukhan desert.
Teklemukhan means the land under the sand. He will teach us, for example, the
beautiful landscape also. One time we saw millions of flowers blooming in the
wide open land. And my father says, look, this is like natural carpet. Natural
carpet. Oh, wow. Go discover how many flowers you can pick. And we will run to
that garden. And we pick all the flowers just like this, you know. Gather them
in your arms. Yeah, and I run to my father, look, so many of them got it. And he
says, okay, do you know about those flowers? Do you know about the names? I
said, no. And he taught us one by one. This is this flower, this is that flower,
you know. So he taught you to love the place, the culture, the people. Yeah, he
unique way to teach us how to love and appreciate what we have. Can I ask in
your childhood home, was there much talk of politics? Was there much talk of the
Chinese Communist Party? Was there much talk of what was going on elsewhere in
China? No, we avoid. We avoid talk about the politics. And the politics getting
harsh, the Uyghurs, the religious politics, you know. What do you mean by
religious politics? Freedom of religion, we lost day by day because of Chinese
government control. And they control all the religious activity in daily life
also. Because it's an officially atheist country. So many new rules make people
life change and harder. The Chinese Communist Party, you'll hear them referred
to as the CCP, had banned anyone under the age of 18 from entering a mosque in
Xinjiang. Praying became strictly regulated. There was also a campaign called
Project Beauty, which prohibited what were described as abnormally large beards
and the wearing of veils in public places. The government claimed this was to
combat Islamic extremism. At the same time, there was a move to impose
mainstream Han, Chinese culture on the region. Uyghurs felt their own culture
was being eroded and complained that they were facing arrest simply for sticking
to their customs. Ghul's family felt it very keenly. Then, a terrible shock.
When Ghul was at university, her younger brother was arrested for theft and
drug-related offences and jailed for ten years. It's the most sad and hard times
for entire family. We just live without light, you know? Everything turned dark.
I stopped smiling. And my parents, too, even we don't watch TV anymore. Very
quiet. Barely eat. Barely talk. I was in third year of my university. I am just
going to school, sitting there, nothing going to my ear. I just think a lot
about him and how I miss him. And my character, my everything was changed. I
don't dance anymore after that. You didn't dance. Yeah, I give up for three
years. All that joy had gone. I feel guilty if I laugh or do something. But
today, I feel I appreciate those days with my inexperience. Maybe those moments
make me more stronger. Yeah. Tell me about the next very big step in your life.
You said right at the beginning that when you were little, you wanted to sing
and dance on TV. You didn't want to speak on TV. So at what point in your life
did you decide, I want to be a TV presenter? Yeah, I started in a nurse day to
be a middle school teacher. I still feel like I can do more. I can give children
more things to teach, even they cannot learn in the school. What sort of things
did you want to teach them? Just what I have learned from my family. Culture,
history, art, all those things. Uyghur culture and history and art. Yes, of
course. And because we don't have a TV program for Uyghur children, I want to
make a Uyghur TV program. What are political implications to making a children's
program? Yes, yes. The purpose to TV station or the radio in China is all
propaganda tools for CCP. Of course, you have to say good things about the
government. You have to praise for CCPs in the program. But because it's the
children program, we're just talking about childhood stuff, what is interesting
for children. So naturally, they don't pay attention that much, what children
are saying. So that's why less sensors for the children program than others. One
of the most innovative aspects of Ghoul's TV show was that it was broadcast in
Uyghur, in London, Mandarin, the main Chinese language. First program, it's very
colorful program. I love camera. I am TV personality, you know. I feel like I'm
born for that. I believe myself so much in front of camera. And your first
program was about music, vegan music. What kind of reaction did it get?
Immediately, we received so many letters from the children. From the parents,
even teachers. And they all love it and appreciate me and say thank you. And
even sending very beautiful cards. And they asked, come to their school to film
them. And asked me to show that, even village kids asking me to show, what is in
Uruqi, you know, what is Uruqi school looks like? What is different life with
the city, with village? They want to make friends with each other, you know,
using my program. And there's so many ideas coming even to making our program
more interesting. So actually the program itself for children, but children's
actually giving me an idea how to develop this program. That's good. I take it
TV sets were more common in Uyghur households by then, if so many people were
watching. Yeah, because that time in 1996, people started to have color TV.
Color TV. And because one TV program for children, so when the children want to
watch, whole family sit together. That's why the children program was the most
watched program many years in the Uyghur region. Was it? Yeah. Wow. How famous
did you become? Pretty famous, I can say. Because everybody can recognize me
when I was in the street everywhere. They will approach me, especially kids. Oh,
Gulchekrad, everybody knows my name. And they call me sister, the little kids,
Gulchekrad Hadeh. Even right now, they grown up, they still call me Hadeh. And
around the world, so many who were exiled contact me with social media and
Facebook. They always say, oh, you are sister forever for us. You are part of
our childhood. So it makes me so happy and proud. It's very sweet saying they
still remember my voice, my smile, my stories. And if I go to restaurant to eat
food, they don't accept my pain. They just say, oh, no, no, this is show our
respect because we love you. Please don't. I feel so blessed everywhere. When
did you first become aware of the Chinese Communist Party taking a more active
interest in the material that you were covering in your programs? After 1997,
they tighten up the rules for programs. Every world program becomes more
censored. Before we air, we have to pass three editors. Also, they have put
someone to translate our program. Into Chinese? Yes. Before that, they don't
translate. And then they will say yes and then we air. That year, 1997, when Guo
says she came under stricter editorial control, there had been protests by
Uighurs, some demanding equal rights, some calling for Xinjiang's independence
from China. There were clashes with police and a number of deaths. The CCP, the
Chinese government, described it as a violent riot. Uighurs called it a
massacre. Thousands of Uighurs were detained, some convicted and imprisoned,
others charged with separatist activity and executed. The authorities stepped up
their assimilation policies. And then they demand us to collaborate with CCPs in
Uighur region, the headquarters. We have to listen to their command, what to put
in our program. They want us to teach friendships, Han Chinese and Uighur kids
program. Showing friendship between Uighur children and Han Chinese children.
And you didn't like that idea? No, because in the real life, they don't play
together, they don't interact. If you falsely put them together, it looks like
fake. It's just for propaganda. And we tried, we tried so hard, we did some
programs, but feel fake, not natural, because the society is not like that. But
do you not think it could have been a sort of a desirable thing to have more
mixing between the two types of children? Yeah, we were thinking playing
together as kids. Of course, it's a good thing, it's make friendship. But real
life, they are not. That's why it makes it uncomfortable. And also, the Chinese
education, politics changed to teaching kids this Han Chinese. We were language
more and more drunk. And every year, thousands of village children, we were
children, moved to mainland China boarding school. A Chinese government planning
document published in 2017 recorded that nearly half a million Uighur children
had been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools in
mainland China. When the policy began in the 90s, Ghul says the authorities
asked her to cover it in her programme and give it what she considered a
positive spin. I was producing all those programmes as those children, and
emotionally, those kids, they were scared in mainland China. They had very harsh
rules to follow. So I feel those children. I saw from their eyes how they cried.
But the Chinese government ordered us to show good stuff about those kids. How
happy are they in those schools? And I asked questions, those kids have to
answer me the written script. So you were given a script by representatives of
the Chinese government to make the children say they were happy in these
schools. Yes, that moment I feel I betrayed my people, betrayed those kids who
love me and listened to me and trust me. I feel guilty. And then I don't want to
do any more of those programmes. But there is no way. If you want to continue
your career, you must follow Chinese government's rule, CCP's rule. As girls'
unhappiness at work increased, her bosses were wanting to promote her. I was the
first bilingual anchor using our native language and the Han Chinese. You have
to pass the examination for that. I passed the examination, then they started to
invite me to present in other Chinese TV programmes. They were giving me more
opportunity to develop and more chance to shine at that moment. Because they
didn't see any threats from me, that's why they liked me. Gül's opportunity to
make a change came in 2001. Her husband had got permission to study in Europe,
in Austria, and Gül was able to visit him. The big difference when you got to
Austria was that you now had access to the uncensored internet. Uncensored
everything actually. In Austria, I opened the internet. It was like, wow, you
can type anything, you can find anything. Even I typed, we were region,
Xinjiang, so many things coming up. I never saw those. It was like a new world
for me. I was studying, I was learning everything from the beginning. I was just
like a child. What were you learning about the Uyghur region and what the
international press were saying about the Uyghur region that you didn't know
from living there yourself? Many things, BBC, CNN, even how we were news. And
then I know there is a radio station about Uyghur region and politics in
America, but we never had an opportunity to listen to the whole programme. It
will be jamming with some kind of music. So I listened to the whole programme,
and when I was listening to the Uyghur programme, everything they said was
shocking. They were like, whoa, they can say this. We never in Uyghur region can
discuss those things. And then I said, wow, freedom of speech is this. Then I
realised, well, this is the journalism I want to work for. Then I decided to
call the radio director, and I said, I'm Guchachra, I'm ready to work for you if
you need me. So... Can I just interrupt there, because I think there's something
we need to make really, really clear, which is how big a deal it is that you
decided you wanted to work for this radio station. It doesn't mean that. This is
not like applying for an ordinary job in radio. No. This is a decision that will
mean that you cannot go home. Yes. That you cannot see your family again. That
you are choosing a life in another continent, in a country where you don't speak
the language, to pursue freedom of speech and give everything up for it. It is a
massive decision you were making. Yes, but this is the only way I can escape
from doing sin to my people. From doing a sin to your people? Yes. Sin means to
promote Chinese government's assimilation politics to yours. I don't want to
part off this assimilation politics. But you could have just given up your job
at Xingjiang TV. You can. You have to have reason. I don't have other choice.
What about your family? Of course, it's hard to make this decision. But I
believe my family, they want me to be free. Ghoul took the job at the Uighur
radio station and moved to America. After a short break, we'll hear what
happened when China made her an enemy of the state and why she keeps a 20-year-
old nan in her freezer. This is the BBC World Service bringing you the story
which uncovered a multimillion-dollar fishing scandal. After independence in
1990, Namibia set out to reclaim the riches of its shores. Instead, the Namibian
fishing sector is embroiled in a scandal on an industrial scale. A friend of
mine called me and told me that you have to meet this guy. I'm Jahan Stell and
I've come to Namibia to find out how the great hopes invested in its fishing
industry have been dashed. It's a story too about how journalists here and in
faraway Iceland are working together, sometimes at personal risk. We were taking
on the most powerful political group in the country. When all this was
happening, I was getting texts. Now it's time for you to get what you deserve
and you don't know what's coming for you. Fish Rot. Clear waters. Merky
dealings. At bbcworldservice.com slash documentaries. Coming up in part two of
Outlook, Uighur journalist Ghouljekra Hodger, on the heavy price her family in
China have paid for her reporting on human rights abuses and why she keeps
20-year-old homemade naan bread in her freezer. It's beautiful handmade naan.
It's very valuable. When I see that, I'm happy and also I will be sad. We're
back after the international news headlines. BBC News with Neil Nunes. Ukraine's
President Vladimir Zelensky has welcomed a vote at the United Nations, calling
for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops. The resolution
was backed by an overwhelming majority of countries, which Mr Zelensky described
as a powerful signal of global support. Today marks exactly a year since the
full-scale invasion began. Poland is fortifying its border with the Russian
exclave of Kaliningrad. The Polish government fears that migrants from Turkey
and the Middle East are being encouraged to travel to the area where they could
cross into the European Union. North Korea has launched four cruise missiles
into the sea. It's the latest in a series of provocative weapons tests. A court
in Los Angeles has sentenced the former Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein to
16 more years in prison. The rape and sexual assault charges date back to 2013.
He's already serving a long sentence for another conviction. Madagascar's
government says a powerful storm which battered the island's east coast has
killed at least seven people. Cyclone Freddy is now heading for Mozambique. A
senior federal investigator in the United States has called for an end to the
politicization of a rail disaster in Ohio. Jennifer Homendy was announcing the

investment firm. A Russian Soyuz capsule has taken off from Kazakhstan to bring
back three men stranded on the International Space Station. The two Russian
cosmonauts and an American are due to return to Earth in September. Their
original capsule sprang a leak. BBC News. Welcome back to Outlook. Hello, I'm Jo
Fidgen. Today we have the shocking story of how a popular children's TV
presenter ended up on China's Most Wanted list. In the 1990s, a young woman from
China's Uighur minority, Gulchehrahodja, created the country's first Uighur
language programme for kids. It made her a star. But Gul became deeply unhappy
when the Chinese Communist Party started to dictate what she could include in
her show. She felt they were expecting her to put a positive gloss on its
increasingly repressive policies towards her people. In 2001, she managed to get
out of China and was hired as a journalist by an independent Uighur radio
station operating out of the United States. She is still there with her husband
and their three children who were born there. She is unable to return to China
or to see her family. I know you didn't tell them before you left for America in
2001. But when you called them to say where you were and that you were working
for this radio station and that you basically couldn't come home anymore, what
did they say to you? When I was called my father, he was quiet a little bit and
says, oh, my break room, then quiet again. And my mum started crying. Yeah, we
didn't talk about, oh, you cannot come back. But we all understand. You were
advised by the radio station to use a false name on air so that you wouldn't be
identified. You chose not to. You chose to use your real name. Why was that?
First, it's my dignity. I want to tell Chinese government this is my decision.
This is me. I want to be me myself. And second, my voice, my face is very
recognizable for my people. Even I don't use my real name. They will recognize
me from my voice. And because of that, there is no point. I don't want to be
seeing I'm scared. So right after I start voicing in radio station in America,
Chinese government, they banned my voice, my profile from the internet, from the
TV, from everywhere, even my images. And they announced first red notes about
me. First red notice. Yes. What is that exactly? What does that mean? What does
it signify? It just comes from the CCP. They're just blaming you. Some kind of
crime I didn't even do. So it's a notice that you are a serious criminal that is
issued on behalf of the Communist Party. Yes. I see. I didn't physically see the
notice by what I hear from the people from where we were reaching to America or
other countries telling me they saw the notice saying I betrayed Chinese
government. I am a separatist. A separatist. Yes, separatist. And then they
warning my families and my friends not to contact with me. And I cut all
contacts from that. I didn't call anyone. You must have felt lonely. It is. It's
very hard. But to protect them, to love them, I have to make this distance. What
kinds of stories were you covering for this radio station that alarmed the
authorities in China so much? First, I start with what I know the best, the
education program. Also human rights issues and forced labor in the Uyghur
region. Also other sensitive topic about the politics. Gull started hearing from
her contacts in Xinjiang about the appearance of a vast complex of camps that
they called Jail City. We now know what is happening inside those camps. The
United Nations estimates that more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims have
been detained there. China says the camps are re-education facilities for
combating terrorism and denies accusations of forced labor, sterilization,
torture, rape and genocide. Back in January 2018, Gull secured the first
interview with a former detainee willing to go on the record about his
experience. If he was the first witness, never have the full picture of what's
behind the wall, what's going on inside those camps. He gives us very detailed
information. The response was swift. After two days, my mother's neighbor's
daughter, she's living in the U.S. studying here. She called me, she says, Oh
sister, I need to inform you, your whole family arrested because of you. It's
all together, 24 people. Twenty-four people from your family arrested in one
night. In one night? One night, including your father and mother. That's the
message and I couldn't believe what I hear. Then I start calling everybody, the
family, nobody answers. Then finally, one of my aunt answered. Her answer was,
don't call again, don't worry about us, just hang up. Yeah, that makes sense,
something happened. So what happened to your relatives, your parents in
particular? My mother, she was 72 years old at that time. My mum was locked with
30 other women, young and old. She was so scared and you cannot sleep enough.
You have to take her to sleep. One woman always watched her, make sure she
doesn't pray. She was shackling, she cannot get up straight. For food, just one
steamed bun. A bun, a steamed bun. Steamed bun. That was all she had to eat in a
day. A little bit of rice, water, maybe so cold. She says, you cannot imagine
how disgusting it is. But I was telling myself, you have to be alive for your
daughter, she was saying. She stayed alive for you? For me. She was fighting for
her life. You went public with what had happened. You taped a letter saying,
this is what's happened to my family. And you posted it to various
organizations, human rights organizations, and to media outlets. And it drew a
lot of attention to your case, and you were asked to speak at a US congressional
hearing, and started speaking very, very publicly about what you describe as
human rights abuses. I want to help my family. I need to do something because I
was the only hope. Because everybody's gone. Even don't know that moment where's
my father. And I feel that's the last, you know, I need to get up and fight for
them. I cannot wait no more. Because for my freedom, for my life, they already
paid so much. Ghul says that all of her relatives were released from jail, but
she continues to speak out. In 2021, Ghul, along with other Uighurs living
abroad, was publicly smeared by Chinese officials in a press conference. She was
accused of bad morality and declared an enemy of the state. And I was put in the
wanted list saying I'm a terrorist. I was participating in some kind of
terrorist organization that didn't say what kind of terrorist organization. So
it's baseless accusation. It doesn't matter how they call you. I believe myself,
I know who I am, and my people knows who I am. So it doesn't define me, what
they say. It's like, I don't know, it's a page of honour, you know, actually. At
the same time, the Chinese authorities released a video showing Ghul's mother
and brother talking about their lives and about her. And your brother says in
that video that he thinks what you're doing is wrong. How did you feel when you
saw and heard that? I'll tell you this, Chris. I'm just happy to see them. I
didn't pay attention to what they said because they forced to say it. It's
clearly, I know. And I see this video again and again, just how I miss them, you
know. I was like paying attention to every detail of their face. And so much
change. My mom unrecognized and my brother too. The image in my mind always is
22 years ago when I was there. I'm imagining them dreaming about them with that
face, not this one. But I was like crying, watching again and again, watching
again. Your father wasn't in the video. I mean, do you know how he is or
anything about him now? Yes, he is in the bed after he had a stroke, half of the
side of his body paralyzed, barely speak. I know you have very, very limited
contact with them. The only person you're allowed to speak to is your mother on
occasion. They did find ways to send you mementos of your family and of your
homeland. Your mother sent you food. Your father sent you a stone. Will you tell
me about those gifts that they sent you? I received some packages from home in
the first couple of years. So that's more than 20 years ago. Yes, it was a man,
you know, homemade bread. We call it man. Made by my mom with her hand. It's
still in my freezer. So you kept that bread that was made by your mum for 20
years or more? 22 years. 22 years. Yes, it's beautiful handmade man, reminds my
mom. And when I see that I'm happy and also I will be sad. Ghoul's children have
strict instructions never to remove it from the freezer. They know that's not
allowed to touch without my permission. This is my man. This is very valuable
for us. No second man in the world, the same. This is only man we have from
momma, from your grandma. So we have to keep this until we saw her, until she
made for second one. And they all know, okay mommy, we don't touch it. And
second thing is my stone. And they know that's like my most precious. Stone is
the most random things in the world. I can pick everywhere, you know, everywhere
have stones. But the stones is from my neighborhood. It's piece of my homeland.
And more interestingly, it smells like home. How would you describe that smell?
The soil after the rain. After rain? After the rain, the soil will have very
special smell. Especially in Urumqi. For me, the most delicious fragrance, I
traveled so many places in the world. But never had the same smell as Urumqi's
soil after the rain. So where do you keep that stone that smells of soil from
Urumqi? In my bedroom, in my bookcase, next to my father's picture, the smell
still in that stone. When I'm missing them, when I'm thinking about them, I just
wrap that stone, well, smell deeply. Do you think your children, who are of
course American, do you think your children will ever smell the soil of Urumqi
for themselves? I wish. But of course, not these days. Do you have regrets for
the decisions you've made? No, never. If I have a chance to make decisions
again, I will make the same decision. Because freedom is everything. Because of
I made these decisions, we have hope right now. I have three beautiful children
living in free country. We were American. So they continue our legacy. That's my
achievement, actually. Your children? Yeah, I can give free life to my children.
That's my biggest achievement. Do you speak Uyghur at home together? Yes, I
always speak Uyghur in our home. Sometimes I teach them to dance. We love to
dance together sometimes. Every Saturday morning, beginning with music, and I
make breakfast. When I listen to music, I feel more happy. Music is part of our
life. Uyghur children's TV presenter turned dissident Guchékwa Hodja, speaking
to me from her home in the USA. She's written a memoir. The title was inspired
by the stone her father sent to her. It's called A Stone Is Most Precious, Where
It Belongs. I'm Jo Fission. Thanks for your company. Out looks back at the
weekend. Music BBC World Service and now Witness History with me, Josephine
McDermott. Today, I'm taking you back to the Chinese city of Shanghai during
World War Two. I've been talking to a former foreign resident, 93-year-old
Christopher John Huxstep, known as John, who was a child living under Japanese
occupation. These were the Easter holiday activities at the school. Initially it
was Senior Girls Netball, followed by Senior Boys Football, followed by Junior
Boys Football, and then Junior Girls and Junior Boys Tennis. Yes, I think I
enjoyed school. Remember that list? We're going to come back to that later. This
is a story about a school like no other. In the 1930s, thousands of European
civilians were living in the glamorous city of Shanghai. Only part of the port
city was governed by China. Another section was controlled by the French, and
the international settlement was run by the British and Americans. After serving
in the First World War, John's father Herbert Huxstep moved to Shanghai in the
1920s to take up a teaching position. There he met John's mother, Agnes. They
were both teachers, and my father ended up as superintendents of education in
the Shanghai Municipal Council, and he is responsible for education in the whole
of international settlement in Shanghai. In 1937, Imperial Japan, allied with
Nazi Germany, invaded Shanghai. As the sons of war fade into the distance, and
Japan's armies swing into Shanghai, there comes one of the tensest international
situations of the whole war. Britain's army commander hurriedly confers with
Japan's officers in an effort to avoid an incident which might lead to more
bloodshed, for Japan refuses to recognise the immunity of the international
settlement. For several years, the settlement carried on, with Japanese
occupiers surrounding it, but in 1941, the United States declared war on Japan.
The people living in the settlement who were from allied nations, mainly the UK
and United States, were rounded up to be held at civilian internment camps. For
John's British family, life was turned upside down. We were at school in
Shanghai at the Cathedral Boy School until April 1943, and at that stage, we
were rounded up and sent off to the Luangwa camp. And how old were you at that
time? I was 13. Luangwa Civilian Assembly Centre was a former teacher training
college on the outskirts of Shanghai, a number of two and three-storey blocks,
many with red brick, all behind barbed wire fencing. Many buildings had cracked
windows, and disease was rife. We arrived there on a great bus load, total, I
think, about two and a half thousand people. What would a typical meal have been
like? When we first went, it was entirely ribbon fish and rice, and for
breakfast, congee, which is a wet rice thing, or cracked wheat. And when we
started off, of course, we had a lot of cracked wheat, and it was full of
weevils. Initially, we would take the wheels out and put them on the edge of the
plate, but later on, because it was protein, we had them. People, basically,
were rarely starved. The way the Japanese worked was, if anyone escaped, people
in their necks beds in their dormitories were immediately hooked off and taken
into Shanghai, but what we think was torture in many cases. Paranoid about
escape attempts, and Japanese would count the inmates in the middle of the
night. We used to have roll call at two o'clock in the morning, and we had no
heating, and it was below freezing. We used to have stands outside our
dormitories for some time an hour, two hours, and they used to come and count us
all. It's very close to the Yankee River, and the wind used to come over quite
strongly. We were certainly not well set for clothes. How would you keep warm?
Use everything you had, your blankets a lot, just to make sure you could
survive, really. We had a fair amount of exchange of clothes between different
people. After all, we were two and a half thousand people, so we had quite a
variety. We very much restricted what we could and couldn't do, and we had very
much curfews and lights out, and the last push was sounded at ten o'clock. Now
remember that list at the beginning, where John mentioned the activities at
school? Well, those actually took place at the camp. Remarkably, in the midst of
all this hardship and suffering, John's father set up a school. Looking through
the papers from the camp, which John keeps in his attic, he's listing here some
of the subjects available at Lung Hua Academy, as they called it, but not even
regular lessons. These were just the evening classes for adults. French,
advanced, there was shorthand, there was Russian, Spanish, and English. We were
able to actually start a school after three months. Chinese Mandarin for
beginners, followed by Chinese Mandarin for advanced. There was a part of the
camp my father set up the school, we were very lucky, although we had 350
children, we had probably as many as 300 people who were prepared to teach. This
was no casual endeavour. A board was set up, there were timetables, and exams
were even prepared for and taken. Our problem was that we were very limited. We
only had round paper bags to write on and pencils. And what did you do for
books? We were very lucky that we were given a week's notice that we were going
to be interned. So my father and my brother and myself went to the Cathedral
Boys' School and we were able to bag up great baskets of books and pencils and
everything we could from the school. And that was then shipped over to the camp,
and we used that. There was a very considerable sort of text books, and they had
to be passed around from one to another. But we were lucky enough, I think,
because we had a very good group of teachers, some of whom were missionaries,
and of course they basically didn't need text books, they just talked from the
top of the heads. What kind of subjects would you have been studying? I was
studying most of the ones that you would expect, mathematics and Latin.
Religious knowledge was very high on the agenda, and French and things like
geography and history, probably about eight or nine normal subjects. Children
received certificates complete with an intricately hand-drawn school emblem on
them. You might think a simple design would have been chosen for ease, given
that it would need to be copied hundreds of times, but it has an elaborate
dragon with scales and a pagoda reaching to the sky. On it is the Latin motto
which translates as nothing we have built this. It was quite professional in a
way. Did you ever receive a certificate? Oh yes, we all got a very nice school
certificate for whatever we managed to accomplish. Music and sport were also a
part of life. The Red Cross were able to give us football, so we were able to
pretend that we were back in normal times. What do you think it meant to you
having this focus on education? Well, I think we were very fortunate that we
were able to continue our education in almost the same way as if we'd still been
in Shanghai, the Cathedral Boy School. I was able to go to a school called Chart
House. I was able to fit in very quickly and resume my normal studies. A
testament to how professionally the school was run is that after the war, an
examinations board in the UK upheld the qualifications the children sat at Lung
Hua, which meant they would count towards their continued education. In
September 1945, China's war with Japan finally came to an end. The thousands of
foreigners held in internment camps were free to go. Christopher John Huxstep
left Shanghai in 1946. He went on to study natural sciences at Cambridge
University and spent most of his career with the company Shell in India and the
UK. He was speaking to me, Josephine McDermott, for that episode of Witness
History. The newsroom is next. This is the BBC.....and the BBC stream you are
