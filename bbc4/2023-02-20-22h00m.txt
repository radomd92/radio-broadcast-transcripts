 We're next. Tomorrow morning at 11 on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. BBC News at 9
o'clock. Police in Lancashire say they have formally identified the body found
yesterday in the River Wyre as Nicola Bulley. The 45-year-old was last seen
walking her dog more than three weeks ago. In a statement, her family thanked
the community for their support, but criticised some recent media coverage as
absolutely appalling. Our reporter Katie Barnfield is at Lancashire Constabulary
headquarters. She says the force is facing mounting questions about its handling
of the investigation. Many questions for Lancashire Police, mounting questions,
particularly after they made that decision last week to release some very
personal and private information about Nicola Bulley's specific vulnerabilities
and of course more questions now this morning after that body has been found and
identified as Nicola Bulley as to why it took three weeks to find her. We
understood she was found in a section of the river that police had already
searched. Joe Biden has pledged the United States long-term support to Ukraine
in its fight against the Russian invasion. He was speaking during a surprise
visit to Kiev today, which Volodymyr Zelensky hailed as the most important visit
in the history of US-Ukraine relations. Seismologists say an earthquake of
magnitude 6.3 has struck southern Turkey near the city of Antakya. Some damage
to buildings has been reported. Two more powerful quakes hit southern Turkey and
northern Syria earlier this month, killing more than 46,000 people. The Northern
Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris says the UK government will pass a law
introducing an opt-out organ donation system in Northern Ireland. The devolved
government at Stormont had intended to introduce the legislation before it
collapsed in 2017. It's known as Darkey's Law after a six-year-old boy who's
waiting for a heart transplant. And supermarkets are facing a shortage of
tomatoes, with shoppers across the UK unable to find them on the shelves. The
supply issues have been caused by bad weather in the Mediterranean. Unusually
cold conditions in Morocco delayed the tomatoes' ripening before rough
conditions stopped ferries and lorries crossing to Europe. BBC News. Now on
Radio 4 we ask, is psychiatry working? Welcome to this journey along the
troubled edges of the mind. Breakdowns of any kind can be terrifying, but lots
of people have them, and with help, lots of people find their ways through them.
Four years ago I had one. I spent 17 days on a psychiatric ward before I was
discharged. My experience of treatment was mixed. On the ward, which was a
caring place, two antipsychotic pills drained the madness out of me. But brief
appointments with psychiatrists and apparently haphazard prescriptions for
powerful long-term drugs made me sceptical. At the time I felt the clinicians
writing the prescriptions could have been replaced by dispensing machines. My
views are much more nuanced now, but I'm not the only former patient with
questions about treatment models. Four years ago, my solution was to turn to
therapy. In this episode, my co-presenter, the renowned psychiatrist Femi
Oyabodi and I, are examining the relationship between psychiatry and
psychotherapy. My name is Horatio Clare, I'm an author and journalist, and we
are asking, is psychiatry working? You have to stabilise the actual symptoms, in
my view, and then you've got a chance to repair all the other things that have
gone wrong. When I first attempted to take my own life, I actually went to a
police station before being taken to hospital. I was arrested and made to be a
criminal. I think we have these two opposite poles. We have excessive coercion
at one end and we have exclusion at the other. We live in a world that's
absolutely obsessed with scans and blood tests. Diagnosis isn't scientific, it's
people making a judgement about other people's behaviour. What's key to this
work is love and kindness. An arm round the shoulder, a hug in the morning. In
researching Heavy Light, the book I wrote about my experiences, I came to the
conclusion that psychiatry views the causes of disorders as multiple and
complex, almost beyond reckoning, and addresses their consequences with
medication. I felt psychotherapy seeks to address and treat those complicated
causes. So, Femi, first, what is psychotherapy? Simply put, psychotherapy is the
use of language, the use of words as a means of treating another human being. So
that is essentially what it is, is a talk therapy. So the difference between a
psychotherapist and a psychiatrist? I'm not sure that there's much of a
difference, to be truthful. Psychiatrists are trained in medicine before they go
into specialist training as psychiatrists. But the psychiatric training itself
involves exposure to and training and supervision in psychotherapy. And I
suppose that in the layperson's mind, the term psychotherapy usually means
somebody who is not medically qualified, who, however, has been trained in some
form of psychotherapy. And when you say it's the use of language and words to
treat somebody, there are different kinds? Yes, there are different kinds of
psychotherapy. So, originally, we would normally think of psychoanalysis as a
form of psychotherapy. So that would be a form of psychotherapy which was
invented by Sigmund Freud, which has this idea that experiences in early
childhood has an incredible force in developing personality and affecting how we
interact and behave and form relationships in adulthood. So that essentially is
psychoanalysis. In modern terms, a lot of people would talk about dynamic
psychotherapy, which is a modern version of psychoanalysis. And then we've got
the other kinds of psychotherapy. So we've got behavioral therapy, which is
based on the idea that our behaviors as adults can be due to particular ways in
which we've been conditioned, so that anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder
and things of that sort, that they derive from impairments or abnormalities of
learning in early childhood or in adulthood, in fact. And cognitive behavioral
therapy, which is very, very popular, which most people would know as CBT, was a
further development along the lines of behavioral therapy, essentially invented
by Aaron Beck. And that says that our emotions are dependent on our thinking.
Therefore, there's an attempt to alter our thinking so that our mood, our
emotions can then be altered. And psychiatry sees a role for all of these? Of
course, of course. All psychiatrists are trained at basic level in
psychotherapy, and then some psychiatrists choose to specialize in
psychotherapy. So they would normally be called medical psychotherapists. So my
distinction between psychotherapy treating causes and psychiatry treating
symptoms is too crude? Oh, definitely. But of course, you're not alone in
thinking about it like that. There's absolutely no question at all that
practically all psychiatrists are fully aware of the ways in which experiences
in early life influence behavior in adult life. Throughout this series, we're
speaking with expert patients. Antonio Ferreira, a student of cognitive
neuroscience, speaker and trainer, spent a considerable amount of time in
inpatient psychiatric services. He's used a combination of medication and
talking therapy to ease his symptoms of schizophrenia. You know, I only found
out about my diagnosis of schizophrenia when I went into a psychiatric unit.
After that came emotions, there were personality disorder, and those two are my
diagnosis now. And what symptoms were you coping with? So I experienced auditory
hallucinations, hearing voices. I was also experiencing delusions, you know,
having the wrong perception of reality. I was experiencing depressive symptoms,
you know, they're called positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. This
is a student in me. And yet, you know, it was paranoia as well. And you can
imagine, you know, you have these symptoms, but these symptoms also create
emotions. So I'm also feeling frustration. I'm also feeling disappointment, you
know, hopelessness. So it's a whole, like, I call it a ratatouille of things.
You know, you've got everything mixed in here going on at the same time. And
talking therapy helped you? Yeah, I think first and foremost, you're getting
opinions from someone else, right? When you're unwell, you know, with a mental
diagnosis, you only listen to yourself. And so a lot of the time you isolate
yourself, so you only hear from yourself. You know, you answer your questions.
So when you actually go CBT, you learn a different perspective. And, you know,
people always say to me, did you prefer a white therapist or did you prefer a
black therapist? And I always said it never mattered if they were white or
black. It just mattered if they were culturally competent, because, you know, I
had white therapists who taught me a lot. You know, they really taught me to
look at things from a different perspective. Then I also had black therapists
who taught me the same thing, right? I remember one therapist saying to me, he
just said, it's not that deep Antonio. And, you know, a lot of people might
think that's not a lot, but because he was relatable, he understood what was
going on. He really, you know, he just said it's not that deep. And sometimes
you just need to hear it to believe it. You know, one thing I learned, you know,
you have this classic example where you walk into a room full of people talking.
And when you walk in, they stop talking. You know, automatically in my head,
they're talking about me. When you go through CBT, you learn from other people,
actually, maybe they're talking about something private and confidential, right?
Having these different perspectives was why I really enjoyed CBT. Normally, we
expect somebody who is on a child and adolescent mental health unit to perhaps
have some introduction to family therapy. Because of course, you're still at the
age where you're at home and where in general our view is that there's a family
system and that the family system has a bearing either on ameliorating or in
some cases causative and so on. So where you, did you have any family therapy?
We was introduced to family therapy, but this is, I think, where it comes into
that cultural over resilience, I'd call it. Because my parents are the ones that
always rejected family therapy. They'd always be like, no, we don't need them
involved in our family. It was that over resilience from, you know, coming from
such a culture. And it's a wonderful term you've used, isn't it? Over
resilience. I mean, tell me a bit more about that. Yeah, you know, I start
again, in analysing everything, looking around, you know, the journey and just
seeing everything around now with a clear mind, I realised minority ethnic
groups have this thing called over resilience because one, what's it called?
Generational trauma, is it? You know, you get passed down this over resilience
because your parents, you see your parents doing, you know, so much, but they're
challenging everything. They're not expressing their mental health, they're not
expressing their weaknesses or vulnerabilities. So you think you also have to be
like that. You know, I've never seen my dad down, never seen my dad cry. So I
can't cry. I have to be this rock. And that is what develops over resilience,
right? So now we don't talk about our vulnerabilities. We talk about our
weaknesses. If something's wrong, no, no, no, we don't, nothing's wrong, you
know, we just power through. And that's probably why we only get sought out at
crisis point. Fermi, Antonio makes the point that a lot of people might think
that in schizophrenia, hearing voices is the worst of it. But actually, he talks
about the effects on his mood and self-esteem. That's right. And that's a very
good point that they had feelings of hopelessness and also he was anxious. And
you can imagine how that might happen because the content of the voices might be
humiliating. It might be saying that he's a worthless person and that sort of
stuff. And that's where psychotherapy comes in. That's where cognitive
behavioral therapy, for example, can be very, very helpful. And it can be
helpful in two ways. One way to think of it is to say if you've got residual
symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or indeed delusions, which
have not fully responded to drug treatment, there's good evidence that cognitive
behavioral therapy can be helpful in that regard. But also that the kind of
feelings of hopelessness and sadness and which resolve from having suffered from
a serious illness, which has disrupted your life, which has affected your
relationships. There in that sort of situation, cognitive behavioral therapy is
also very helpful. Antonio also said that it didn't matter who gave him therapy
in terms of culture, ethnicity. His phrase was it didn't matter as long as they
were culturally competent. So it might be helpful if I just say something about
whether or not there's ethnic congruence. There's some work and some people
believe that you've got to come from the same ethnic group when you're doing
psychotherapy and that that is much more likely to produce good outcomes. I
myself have difficulty with those sort of ideas. I certainly agree with Antonio
that cultural competence matters. In other words, you've got to have a therapist
who is flexible and open minded, who is able to recognize that their own
cultural narratives, that their own cultural context is not superior. And is
able to take account of the fact that there are other ways in which human beings
live. And this will be true for whether we're discussing a patient who comes
from a working class cultural context and you've got a therapist who is upper
middle class culture. So the same issue arises. It's just that these issues,
essentially they are amplified when you've got a cultural difference, which is
of greater magnitude because the person comes from Asia or Africa or from the
Middle East or something of that sort. Antonio references it and my own
experience of inpatient care speaks to it too. How much is available and is it
sufficiently explained and understood, do you think, both by psychiatry and by
patient? If we're talking about what's available in inpatient services, I think
very little is available. The duration of stay in inpatient services, definitely
in England at present, is on average 21 to 28 days. And so people are coming in
when they're very disturbed and they've been discharged even before they've
fully returned to what we might call normal. Therefore, the ability to do
psychotherapy of any kind in that state and in that short duration is obviously
compromised. But it's also important to say that we used to have inpatient
psychotherapy services usually dedicated explicitly to people with personality
disorders, and the funding for those services have been cut. Therefore, even the
dedicated inpatient psychotherapy services no longer exist as they did. So there
are profound differences between what psychology and psychiatry offer. In
psychiatry, the tools are overwhelmingly but not exclusively chemical. In
psychotherapy, speech, thoughts and behaviour are the focus. Therapists cannot
prescribe. Katie Mason is a psychiatrist who takes what she calls a holistic
approach. She specialises in talking therapy. She works in forensic and
community services in Manchester. There's evidence that psychotherapy can be
used with a lot of different illnesses. For example, schizophrenia, the
treatment psychotherapy is better as an adjunct to medication. As a standalone,
it wouldn't reduce admissions or relapses. But what it can do is have an impact
on symptoms and the distress caused by them. And in illness, it's a very
important tool. It can help to prevent relapse. And why it does that is it
addresses symptoms that occur in depression. So it can be really, really
helpful, just as it would be for treating depression because of depression
rather than bipolar affective disorder. But also it helps address feelings of
guilt or negative thoughts that you've had if someone's had a what we call a
manic episode. Whether not themselves and they're very high, they can sometimes
do things which cause them a lot of guilt and shame. And actually being able to
work through those feelings can really help someone come to terms with the
illness that they've had. It can also help prevent relapse because if people
have come to terms with their diagnosis better, they might be more likely to go
to the doctor to present to the doctor to see if they're going to be able to
treat it. They might be more likely to go to the doctor to present to the doctor
and say, actually, I don't think I'm feeling very well. I think I'm starting to
get unwell again and we can catch it earlier. And so having some therapy can
help people identify when they're becoming unwell. Could you talk about what was
called the therapist effect, the idea that the most effective thing about
therapy is the relationship with the therapist as opposed to the modality? Yes.
So there's definitely evidence that a lot of the therapies seem to come out with
a common evidence base in that they seem to work as well as each other. And
they've identified that the key thing is the relationship with the therapist. So
things that might be kind of common factors, things about the qualities in the
therapist, having that structure, having that treatment, that place to go to
think about yourself and that time to focus on yourself and your difficulties.
Yes. And when I still practiced on a day to day basis, I used to be concerned
about the fact that psychotherapists were, if you wish, averse to risk. And that
if there were patients where there was a risk of suicide or harm to others, then
it was generally speaking quite hard to persuade psychotherapists to take on
those sort of patients. And I suppose what I want to ask you is, you know, what
are the methods and systems that are available to psychotherapists in the NHS to
take on people who, if there wasn't a risk to suffer others, they might have
been regarded as suitable. We need the systems around therapists to be able to
deliver therapy effectively so that if somebody does become very, very
distressed about what's happening in therapy, their therapist isn't the one
that's making decisions about do they need admission to hospital, do they need
medication? Because that power dynamic can really impact the therapy and make it
effectively break down. And so I think the systems need to be in place that if
people are struggling with therapy, that they can they can get help alongside
the therapy from somebody totally different. But also, I guess if somebody is in
the place where they are feeling very, very suicidal, it may not be the right
time for them to start exploring what's made them feel that way. Although that
might seem a bit paradoxical, but you need to be in a slightly better place to
be able to manage to do that. I wonder as a psychiatrist who focuses a lot on
talking therapies, is psychiatry working from your point of view? I think it
could be better. I think psychiatrists at the moment need more time to have
their relationships with their patients. The doctor patient relationship when
you're dealing with chronic mental health conditions is really, really
complicated. For example, if someone is feeling suicidal, there isn't an obvious
time when they need to come into hospital. It might depend on a lot of things,
how much that's going to disempower them to be able to cope on their own, what
their support structures are like at home, whether being an inpatient has helped
them. There's not a kind of an algorithm that can tell you that. You've got to
know your patients. I think psychiatry could be a lot more relational than it is
at the moment. We sort of seem to be getting pushed into boxes of where you do
the prescribing, and that's just not true. I don't think our patients want that
to be true at all. I think it's so frustrating when you've got patients who
might do really, really well with some therapy and are really keen and really
want it, and they can't get access to it. There are as many different therapies
as there are therapists, and a multitude of types. What you get depends on what
you can find, access or afford. Art therapy, movement, music, dance, gestalt,
family, humanistic therapy. The British Association of Counselling and
Psychotherapy lists over 30 categories. I had an extremely positive experience
of EMDR, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing. It's one of the newer
modalities and known to be especially effective with trauma. It is available on
the NHS if you have a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress. I had to go private.
Dr Robin Logie is a clinical psychologist and EMDR therapist. He's been doing
this type of work for two decades. To be honest, I thought it was a load of
hocus-pocus when I first encountered it, because it did seem very strange. But
it kind of suited me very well, because I kind of like the structured approach
of CBT, but I wanted something that would take me back to what had actually
happened to people and to help them to reprocess the traumatic events or adverse
life experiences that they'd had earlier on in their life. Can you explain why
it might look from the outside and it did to you like hocus-pocus? And what
actually happens in an EMDR session? I think the hocus-pocus bit is where we're
actually asking the client to think about what's happened to them with the
negative belief that's accompanied that and the emotion and where they feel it
in their body, whilst moving their eyes from side to side. And that does seem
very strange. But actually, when you find out what's involved, it does start to
make sense. What I first do is I take a thorough history and really get a sense
of what the problems are that you have and how they relate to what's happened to
you. And then the second stage is to make sure that the client is prepared, that
they actually psychologically have a firm enough psychological platform on which
to stand before they start looking at the trauma. And then what we do is we do a
very careful assessment procedure where we ask them to think about a particular
key event in their life that is still causing them to have the negative feelings
and negative beliefs that they have. For example, it may be they were in a road
traffic accident and the negative belief might be, I'm not safe. So we identify
that and when then we get to find out what they would like to believe, which
would probably be I am safe. Then we get them to tell us what emotion is
associated with that and where they feel that in their body. And we get all
those together. And that's when we start to do the eye movement bit. It's not
clear yet why the eye movement works, but there has been quite considerable
amounts of research that shows that if you do exactly the same thing with and
without eye movements, that it doesn't seem to be so effective. And so there's a
number of theories and one of the dominant theories is to do with the way in
which the eye movements are kind of distracting the client and keeping them to a
certain extent still in the here and now, whilst they're actually revisiting
what happened to them in the past. Can I understand a little bit more about, do
you work with people with depression and how does EMDR help them? I do.
Initially, it was only with people with post-traumatic stress disorder, which is
an obvious population with which to use EMDR because the actual nature of the
diagnosis relates to trauma. But we're using it increasingly with people with,
for example, depression, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychosis. And
although the research evidence isn't as established in those areas, we're
getting extremely kind of interesting, exciting results with a whole range of
different psychological disorders. And in my experience, people with depression
have had attachment related problems as a child very often. What I mean by
attachment related problems is they haven't been able to form a secure
attachment to a parent, a mother or a father. So I had a client who told me that
a particular moment in her life sort of summed up her adolescence. And what
happened was that she'd come home from school with a couple of mates and they
were just going to stay at her house and hang out together. And when she walked
in the front door, she found that her mother was comatose on the sofa, having
been very heavily drinking. And the first thing that she did was she told her
friends that they couldn't stay and she'd see them the next day. And then she
roused her mother and helped her up the stairs and put her to bed, cleaned up
the house, started cooking the dinner. And when her dad came home from work, he
said, how are you? And she said, I'm fine. I've got the tea ready. Mom's
upstairs having a rest. And by just finding that particular key moment in her
life, which was obviously a moment that represented many other similar things
that happened to her in her life, it helps us to sort of tap into what had been
going on for her. She was the person in the family who was expected to look
after everybody else. And she therefore had no feeling of valuing herself as an
individual, no feeling of I'm an okay person. And she had in relation to that
feelings of worthlessness, feeling not good enough, which is often, you know,
kind of relates to depression. It's so telling. And so then you locate a place
in the body for that, do you? Yeah, I would ask her, yeah, what negative
beliefs? So she might be I'm not good enough. What you'd like to believe is I'm
an okay person. And then what emotion she's experiencing and where she
experiences that in her body. And then we just, well, we just get to hold those
things in her mind while she starts, we start doing the eye movements. What was
the effect of the therapy? I know that it was very effective. And we didn't have
to go and look at all sorts of other things that had happened during her
childhood. It generalized, if you like, to her whole childhood, she was starting
to feel okay about herself and feeling that she was a worthwhile person. So
Femi, the sense we got from Robin Logie is that trauma underlies a huge spectrum
of mental health problems and that EMDR targets it. How does psychiatry think
about trauma? There are problems associated with the term because there's a kind
of objective way of thinking what trauma might be made of. So you could argue
that trauma usually would be an experience where your life has been at risk or
where you have witnessed something which is uncommon. So you might have
witnessed somebody being stabbed or witnessed a relative being killed in a very
traumatic sort of manner, or you might have served in the army in the front
line. So everybody would agree that those are objectively true experiences of
traumatic events. And then there's the complication that subjectively you might
think that you've had an experience that's traumatic, which if you were then to
describe that to other people, they might feel that it somehow is relatively
trivial. That's not to say it's not traumatic, because of course there what
we're discussing is how you might yourself label something because it may be
totally out of proportion to the background experiences that you've had. Or it
may be that even though it sounds relatively trivial, it occurs so frequently
that the cumulative effect is substantive. So that's just discussing how to look
at what trauma might mean. I think that it can't be true that all psychiatric
disorders are a consequence of trauma. But that's not saying that trauma doesn't
produce psychiatric events. In the course of this series, we've examined lots of
different disputes and questions about how psychiatry sees things versus how
perhaps sufferers see things or how psychotherapists see things. But my sense in
this episode is that psychiatry and psychotherapy are coming together in many
ways. And despite the sort of headline disputes from the more extreme wings,
there is a recognition, isn't there, that there are two sides of the same
hopeful process? I don't think there are many psychiatrists practicing in the UK
who don't accept that psychotherapy is important. And I don't think there are
people practicing in the UK who don't agree that a combination of drug treatment
and psychotherapy is the best that's available to us at present. So yes, I agree
with you that there's a kind of confluence of ideas and beliefs. As a travel
writer, I have been privileged to make some extraordinary journeys, among them
my experiences of therapy. Venturing back into early childhood, the
understanding of how an outwardly confident person can be beset inside by
profound doubts about self-worth, leading to all kinds of repressions and
divisions, and understanding how these influence behaviour and perspective was
life-changing. Many breakdowns lead to journeys of healing and recovery. In the
next episode, we go in search of answers to the questions that mental suffering
asks. What are the ways forward? How can we best be healed? What does the future
of recovery look like? That's next time in our series, Is Psychiatry Working?
Now on Radio 4, with a look ahead to the world tonight at 10, we're joined by
Ritala Shah. Thanks, Ritala. Now on Radio 4, here's Adam Rutherford with Start
the Week. Hello. Today we have ancient wisdom, both empirical and folk, and
humankind's position in nature. Elixir in the Valley at the End of Time is the
new book by Kapka Kasabova, in which he takes us to the southern Balkans to
explore the relationship between the land and the plants and the people of the
ancient river valley of the Mesta. We're introduced to the Pomaks, a persecuted
group of healers and mystics who are enchanted by the edible earth. We're
submerged in nature and our place in it as well in a new staging of Dvorak's
opera Rusalka, the tale of a water sprite who undergoes a brutal transformation
for love, only to find humankind holds little love for her. Co-director Anjie
invites us to contemplate our attempts to own and tame the natural world. But we
begin with Anaximander. Who, you may well ask? Well, cosmologist and writer
Carlo Rovelli's biography makes a bold and persuasive case that this ancient
Greek philosopher-scientist was the first geographer, the first biologist, a
pioneering astronomer and the founder of critical thinking. Quite the resume. So
why have we not heard of him? So, Carlo, let's just start with the biography.
Who and when was Anaximander? Thank you, Adam. Anaximander lived 26 centuries
ago in what is now Turkey. We are in the early period of the Greek civilization.
So he lived in Miletus, was a Greek city on the coast of Asia Minor. And it's
sometimes considered as one of the first philosophers. We are just situated
before the classic period, before everybody you can think about in Greece, like
Plato or Aristotle or the great poets. Well, I think we want to talk about the
astronomy more specifically, but justify that claim that he's the first
geographer and the first biologist. He wrote a book. The book is called
Periphusis on Nature. And from the name of his book, Physis, Nature, Physics,
which is my field, our field. There is a jump between everything we can read
before him and him and his school and what happened next. And the jump is very
strong. Up to that point, the justification of the explanation of all the
natural phenomena was always connected to the existence of God's supernatural.
And suddenly, with Anaximander and his school, that period, there is a new way
of thinking that comes in, which is talk about physical phenomena in terms of
physical phenomena, in terms of naturalistic explanation. And that's a big jump.
Let me make one example, just to start, before going into astronomy and the
cosmology, which is really his great claim of fame. When it rains, where does
rain come from? I mean, I remember studying it at school and I remember being
quite fascinated, right? The rain comes down, water comes down with rain, goes
to the rivers, to the ocean, then evaporates and then goes up in the sky and
then it condensates, comes down. So this circle of water. So the water of the
rain comes from the evaporation of the seas. Well, who understood that?
Anaximander. Up to that point, any reference to the rain was that rain comes
because some gods send it. The winds come because there's a God who is blowing
and so on and so forth. So there is a sudden change from supernatural
explanations to naturalistic explanations. And together with this, and now I
come to what is probably his central point and what really started my love for
Anaximander, because I'm in love with this guy. He is a moment in which
humankind started thinking that reality can be very different than the way it
has been thought up to that point. And you can rethink the world entirely in a
new way. And that's magic. That's fascinating. And he brought about what is, I
believe, and that's the core of his legacy, what is the greatest revolution in
human thinking, because the first one, which is realizing that the sky is not
just above us, but it's all around us, that the earth is a stone that floats in
the middle of the space without falling. And whereas most other cultures and
thinking of where the earth is in relation to the heavens is it's simply above
us rather than surrounding us. Where does this, this is an empirical view for
him. Where does it come from? How does he reach that conclusion? The interesting
thing is that in a sense, it's not too hard to realize that the sky is not just
over our head, but it's also below our feet. Because we see the sun going down
in the west, right? And then the morning after we see it coming out in the east.
So where did it go through? And we see the moon and the stars all going sort of
clearly around us. So it's come pretty natural to think that the sky is rotating
around us somehow. And so it should be empty below the earth. Centuries,
millennia of previous civilization in China, in India, in Africa, in the
American civilization. All the other civilizations until they learned from the
Greek and from Anaximander always thought that the earth has to rest on
something. More earth or some columns like the Bible or a big elephant or a
turtle or something. Turtles all the way down. Turtles all the way down,
exactly. So how come that nobody makes this jump? Well, because it's very hard
to think that the earth doesn't fall. So the genius in Anaximander was to
address the question. All right. So the earth should fly so that everything goes
around. Why doesn't it flow? And the genius was for him to reformulate the
question and ask, why should it fall? Right. We see things falling, but why
should we extrapolate that to the earth itself falling? Maybe falling is just
relative to where you are on earth. But to do that, you have to rethink what is
the meaning of up and down, of high and low. You have to reconceptualize the
world. And this is science. That's how science starts. When you have a vision of
the world and you realize that maybe I can think things completely differently
and maybe it makes more sense. And he convinced everybody. He convinced the
Greek and then slowly the Greek convinced the rest of the planet. I was just
thinking as Carl was talking about this, the merging of specialities which used
to exist versus this sharp division of sort of specialisms. We have very little
understanding of alchemy today. It mostly has a psychological dimension. And so
it should. But alchemy is really the basis of chemistry. And it was only in the
16th, 17th century that with Nicholas Calpipa, who was the great English medical
herbalist, that this separation occurred, a radical separation between the world
of botany and the world of medicine. And that's where alchemy kind of fades out
and chemistry comes in. So I was just thinking also of Herodotus, who I think is
a contemporary of Anaximander, who was a historian, a geographer, a philosopher,
an early anthropologist and ethnographer. Again, that kind of fusion of
specialisms. And I'm kind of I'm yearning in my own writing and research for
this, I suppose, plurality of interests. Well, I think that the separation of
the problems is it's always something that blinds us to think. And the view of
Anaximander suffers exactly for that, because the reason some people who plunge
into Anaximander consider him one of the greatest thinkers of humankind. So why
is not more known? Because the scientists don't look at the historical figures
like Anaximander and the people who look at the historical figures like
Anaximander don't understand science. And that's... Oh, people will complain.
Okay, let them do. This reciprocal blindness has the effect that misses the
importance he had in the history of civilization, precisely because those who
think about the history and the history of philosophical idea usually has a
formation and education, not a scientific training. And those who have the
scientific training don't look at philosophy and history. So there is a
separation of knowledges that make us blind to the complexity. And Anaximander
is two millennia, more than almost three millennia ago. I think in thinking what
happened at the time and how historically this way of thinking started something
that comes to today, we understand better the roots of our own understanding of
the world. So the prefiguring ideas like evolution, like Darwinian evolution,
which I think you make a persuasive case for. But one of the key things that you
talk about in Anaximander's thinking is that he's quite open to being wrong. He
makes many mistakes as everyone does. And in fact, as you argue, scientists
should aim for that being wrong is really a cornerstone of how we work out what
is right. And that comes from your guy. Once I wrote a small article on Einstein
noticing that Einstein is the one who got more things right about nature
probably than anybody else in the last century, last three centuries, but he's
also the one who made more mistakes. I could list the mistake of Einstein, 2030,
very big mistakes. I mean, so he was not afraid of making mistakes. And I think
that's the point. Understanding that what we know can be wrong, that what we say
can be wrong and what we learn can be partly correct, but then it will be
corrected and ameliorated again. That's the core of critical thinking. And in
antiquity, there is criticism, of course, through the Bible, what it says about
Babylonian knowledge is just brutally critical. Or there is a faithful following
a master and following a school and but not criticizing anything. So Anaximander
comes out, or at least what happened in Miletus at that time comes out as a
discovery of a third way. You can learn from the past and at the same time be
aware that what is in what you learn, it's wrong. That's the beginning of
critical thinking, which also means that you contribute to something knowing
that could be wrong and somebody can correct it. And that's fine. So the idea of
being wrong and being self-correcting is fundamental to science. I want to move
on to Rusalka and Anji, the co-director of the new opera, Dvořák's opera, where
in fact, trying to work out what mistakes you've made is a crucial part of the
plot. Perhaps you could just begin by sort of summarizing the overall story.
Rusalka is a Czech fairy tale about a water spirit who falls in love with a
human prince. In our production, we will explore during the prelude to Act One,
this moment where the prince dives into Rusalka's lake, and they experience what
he experiences, this amazing feeling of being in the water. And she has this
amazing experience of being close and connected to a human. From that
experience, she decides to leave her natural environment, lake, the surrounding
woodlands, which is an idyllic place to be, absolutely beautiful, full of
harmony, full of adventure. And she tells her dad that she wants to leave and
join the human world. Her father warns her of the dangers of the human world,
but she's determined. And therefore, she has to go find this wise woman in the
woods, the only medicine woman who's capable of assisting her in this
transformation. She discovers she has to sacrifice her watery identity and her
voice in order to become human, which is an incredible statement to ask a woman
to lose her voice and an opera singer to lose her voice. And it is a brutal
transformation too, bloody and gory. Not normally portrayed in the libretto,
Rusalka traditionally goes into a hut, and Yeji Baba transforms her inside the
hut, and then she comes out as a human. What we've done, what Natalie and I have
done in our production and our design team is we have asked questions about what
it means to sacrifice and decided to place it theatrically in the space. And so
you watch the watery array being removed. It is a very striking moment. So and
then she comes to the surface world and in a more contemporary setting and with
her prince and things don't quite go according to plan. No, no, they don't quite
go according to plan. It's not unlike, I think, anybody's human experience of
thinking, oh, if I do this, it's going to be like that. Here's an idea of
something and that idea will be exactly what I think it is. You make the
sacrifices, you make the choices, then you arrive in the new world. And no, it's
not what you thought it was at all, especially if you don't have a way to
communicate, especially if you're out of your element in another new culture
that isn't being quite receptive to the fact that you are unsure of what's going
on. So the prince betrays her. Spoiler alert. And because she has no voice and
can't communicate, she's kind of lost and her father comes back and takes her
back. In Act Three, then the prince, tortured by his betrayal, comes back
looking for Rusalca. And she is now in a cursed loneliness and a very barren
version of the previous Adil that we saw in Act One, almost apocalyptic. And he
begs forgiveness. And in this particular fairy tale, forgiveness means death.
And so she grants him peace. It's an unexpected redemption story. It's a very
dramatic scene in the second act when Rusalca is stripped of her voice, which is
a very bold move to have a pretty much a whole act where the soprano makes not a
sound but is present on stage. It's a sort of wedding party scene and it's witty
and funny and it's like a, it looks like a vampire wedding, but they're all
covered in oil. Yeah. A sort of sticky gloop as they as they vogue around the
stage. And this feels very much like, well, this is our exploitation of fossil
fuels. We want to demonstrate their appetite. And so we've covered the chorus in
this kind of reflective, Anne-Marie Woods, our costume designer, this kind of
reflective, slick costume. And the chorus and the dancers ooze around the stage,
around Rusalca, who's strapped into this kind of corseted idea of more molding
her into a new culture. Sustainability is part of the production as well. The
way the set is designed underwater in the forests with enormous tendrils. Tell
us about how you wove sustainability into the production. So it's that we asked
ourselves a lot of questions. So originally we had water on stage. We we
originally in the dreaming up of the design had fire on stage. You ask yourself
the questions. The water is going to have to be heated. The water is going to
need chemicals in it. It's going to have to change over. How do we represent the
devastation in Act Three with the poison slime of the water? Oh, we'll have to
color the water. And then you kind of see the footprint of all of these choices.
And then you go to your you. We asked ourselves these questions. We asked our
creative team these questions. Do we need that? What what else can we do? And
then you go to your imagination, which is your primary resource. And you go,
what's another way to do that? So we no longer have water on stage. We no longer
have fire on stage. And the forest, the tendrils that come down are primarily
made from recycled materials and costumes from a 1991 Carmen at the R.O.H. It's
very effective. How do you deal with the fact that if I get it right, at the
end, the prince has a choice between kissing her or not. And kissing her means
asking for forgiveness, but also means dying. It seems a very pessimistic
alternative. The only way for him at that point to accept love is to renounce
life. How do you deal with that? I think that in the poetry of it, to recognize
that you're part of a whole and that the whole requires give and take and
sacrifice and loss. And that he comes back and he specifically says, kiss me,
kiss me, kiss me, kiss me forever. He's very clear that the only release from
his actions, his pain, what he's going through is death. And I think it's just
it's a beautiful exchange of seeing someone sacrifice and understanding you can
make your own. I think opera is always about life and death and these really big
conversations. And so you can take that and expand it to see how it can
transform into other actions. Well, I think we've seen that in Rusalka there is
this learning from one's mistakes and that has resonance with Anaximander and
Carlo Rovelli's work. But Kapka, you must have seen so many resonances in
Rusalka in the relationship between the land and people and exploitation and
sustainability in everything that you write. Absolutely. I was just thinking
what an alchemical tale in a way Rusalka is, you know, in the sense that it's a
tale of transformation. It's you know, the word heal comes from whole from an
old Germanic word meaning whole. And I explore that in my book. OK, well, let's
talk about Alexia, which is the title of the book. The subtitle is In the Valley
at the End of Time. Set it in time and space, calling it this valley, the end of
time. Where is it? Why is it so special? This is the upper basin of an old river
called Mesta or Nestos in Greece. It traverses Bulgaria and Greece. And I
focused on the upper basin of it, which is framed by three mountains, three of
Europe's great mountains, Rila, Rodopi and Pyrin. It's an extraordinarily
beautiful place. It's also, despite the various ravages brought by exploitative
politics during communism and neglect post-communism, still largely preserved
compared to other, I suppose, other biospheres, other ecosystems that that we're
familiar with. And I was drawn to that place, first of all, instinctively. I
fell in love with it. It's a very electrical place. The mountains have these
electrical storms. And I sensed that there was there was a trail to to kind of
to follow there. And I started meeting the people of the valley. It's actually
several valleys. You know, it's quite an extensive geographic sort of territory.
But I focused on staying with different communities there and getting to know
how people relate to their place and discovering a lot of suffering at the
collective and personal level and a lot of old knowledge of plants. And yeah,
and the story there is vast. Tell us about the peoples of this region, because
you spend a lot of time with the Pomac. And I was unaware of their existence as
this European ethnicity or group of people who are really right in this valley.
And they are absolutely central to your tale. Yes, this is their territory. The
Pomacs are, you know, very little known Europeans, and yet they're tremendously
interesting culturally. They're a syncretic culture. They're Muslims, Bulgarian
speaking Muslims, and they're spread throughout the southern Balkans with the
greatest concentration in Bulgaria, but also in Greece, Turkey, Macedonia. They
are indigenous people who at some point adopted Islam. We're talking a few
centuries ago. And the reason why they have a deeper connection still with place
is not because they're not affected by, you know, mass emigration, economic
desperation, and all the other kind of fallout of the end of communism. And this
link with the land, I think, has given them, at least on the collective level, a
kind of cohesion that other communities may lack. So, yes, they are a specific
syncretic culture because they combine a sort of form of Islam with a pagan form
of relationship with the earth, you might say, a kind of, you know, nature cults
are still alive in those communities. And how do you fit into this? How do you
feel comfortable in this area? You're born in Sofia, but you live in rural,
remote Scotland today. How did you feel like you fit in with the people and the
landscape? Well, I speak the language, but for me, this was a completely new
kind of region. It was a process of discovery for me. I wanted to learn about
plants, about people, about their history. And, you know, going back to this
idea with Anaximander of sort of mixing different currents. This is very much,
for me, the process of writing about the place is almost the process of
mirroring the nature of that place as it emerges, you know, the spirit of the
place through the guides that I find on the ground, based on the stories of
people who generously kind of, you know, took me with them through the story of
their lives, but also through their valley, you know, through their plant
knowledge. And some of these people are walking encyclopedias, and these people
have no worldly power, but a lot of earthly power. And so for me, it was a
deeply humbling process of learning the full extent of what it means to be, for
me, a citizen of the earth. Their integration, and indeed your integration with
the plants. You talk a lot about edible plants. There's amazing naming of
plants, many of which people have heard of, many I hadn't. But when you talk
about edible plants, it's not traditional vegetables, as you might buy from the
supermarket. Is this part of, in your narrative, are you deliberately trying to
disabuse us of what we consider edible plants? Well, I wasn't deliberately
trying to do anything. I was simply following these people on their, you know,
on their trails. So for example, I spent time with plant gatherers. These are,
you know, some of Europe's top experts in medicinal and gourmet plants. So we're
talking about gourmet mushrooms, which we end up, you know, buying at a premium,
you know, in small, in small packets in our deli shops, porcini for our risotto.
Well, the people who pick these mushrooms are usually Roma, gypsies, you know,
they make almost no money from it. And there's all the medicinal plants that are
gathered in, you know, in the region, again, sold at a premium. So I became
interested in this whole question of the supply chain, you know, from picker on
the ground, a person with great, great plant knowledge to the wholesale buyer.
And I spent time with a guy called locally known as Rocky the Enchanter, called
after a flower, you know, dubbed the Enchanter. It's actually Red Evans. He is a
walking encyclopedia, you know, he can name over 700 plants, medicinal plants,
plus their regional names. And do you think that this knowledge is being lost?
How do we maintain that knowledge? This is, this is what I found so poignant
that all of these people work in lineages of plant knowledge. These lineages go
back to antiquity, they go back to Theophrastus, who was one of the first
botanists, and we do have his works. I tapped a little bit into his description,
there's a tremendous description by Theophrastus of a man who turns into a
plant. You know, we're in the realm of sort of magical poetry here, which is
also a big part of being a plant gatherer or a plant buyer, or a herbalist, you
have to understand the language of plants. And the loss of the lineage is
something poignant. Rocky the Enchanter was keen to kind of keen for me to spend
time with him, even though there is always the fear that you will steal some of
the knowledge. Now, this is another sort of ancient thing that, you know, it's,
it should be sort of guarded, you know, the knowledge should be guarded. It's
only for the adepts for the initiated. Yet, you know, he said to me, you know,
my children are not interested. I have nobody, you know, this business, this
whole thing dies with me. This feels like a theme that runs through both
Anaximander and Rusalka, that how do we maintain knowledge? How do we learn from
the mistakes? Do you see, Carlo, do you see parallels? Well, what happened at
the time of Anaximander was exactly the moment, exactly the moment in which the
idea that knowledge should be kept secret was supplanted by the idea that if you
write a book and spread the knowledge to everybody, this is an advantage for
everybody. This is a century when writing became a common knowledge among people
and people started writing book. And what Anaximander did, which was a big break
with tradition, is to write a book, putting everything he knew in prose. In
fact, the little that was published before was in verses and poetry. And by
breaking this millenary tradition of secret knowledge, from now on, knowledge
could be diffused and contested and developed by everybody. And that is why
books like Alexia by Kapka Kasabova need to be read. That is out now. Carlo
Rovelli's Anaximander and the Nature of Science, which was translated from the
original Italian by Mariannina Rosenberg. That's published later this week. And
Rusalka, co-directed by Anyi and Natalie Abrahami, is on at the Royal Opera
House until the 7th of March. Many thanks to today's studio engineer, Tim
Heffer. Next week, capitalism under the spotlight. Tom Sutcliffe talks to Bernie
Sanders. But for now, thank you and goodbye. Next week, West Scotland and the
Northern Isles will have more persistent rain for a time. And the west of
Northern Ireland and North West Scotland will see spells of heavy rain later.
Then on Wednesday, we'll have more rain pushing east across the UK, with sunny
spells and showers following on behind. On 92 to 95 FM on 19.
