 From us, remember tomorrow, Lisa Doucette will be presenting this programme
from Kiev and the Archbishop of Canterbury will be doing a special thought for
the day, as he did a year ago tomorrow on the morning of the invasion of
Ukraine. Good morning. BBC News at nine o'clock. The Labour leader, Sikir
Starmer, is launching what he calls five national missions, outlining his plans
for the UK if Labour wins the next general election. The commitments will be
announced during a speech in Manchester this morning. The missions include
pledges to improve the UK's economic growth, make the country a clean energy
superpower and reduce health inequalities. On the Today programme, Sikir denied
that the plans lacked detail. The missions are not vague, they are very clear,
they're ambitious. What sits underneath these missions are the specifics. What
then are you going to do to get this to happen? And so we have the specific, I
don't know, the columns, if you like, that hold the missions up and then what
I'm going to set out this morning in my speech is then what are the first steps
along the journey. Police say the dissident Republican group, the New IRA, is
the main focus of detectives investigating the shooting of an off-duty police
officer at a sports complex in Oma in County Tyrone last night. Detective Chief
Inspector John Caldwell is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. The
government has confirmed plans to establish the first independent regulator of
men's football in England, the body which was recommended in a fan review last
year, will aim to make clubs financially resilient, give fans greater input and
have the power to stop clubs joining breakaway leagues. The cases of 12,000
asylum seekers are to be fast-tracked by the Home Office to try to fulfil Rishi
Sunak's pledge to reduce the backlog of applications by the end of the year.
Migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen will have their
claims decided on the basis of a questionnaire rather than in person. A
collection of more than 80,000 items linked to David Bowie have been acquired by
the Victoria and Albert Museum to be put on public display. Members of the
public will be able to see the singer's lyrics, sheet music and costumes at the
newly created David Bowie Centre in East London in two years' time. BBC News.
This is BBC Radio 4, where later this morning we have a special edition from our
own correspondent as we approach a year of the war in Ukraine. We'll hear
personal reflections from the conflict zone and around the world. Ola Gherin
reports on the everyday danger in the Donbass. In Moscow, Steve Rosenberg will
tell us about the propaganda fed to Russian citizens. And our US editor Sarah
Smith lets us in on some of the secrecy behind President Biden's surprise visit
to Kiev. That's all in from our own correspondent at 11 o'clock. And if you're
in the mood for some music this morning, why not try the classical mixtape on
BBC Sounds. But now on Radio 4, it's In Our Time with Melvin Brack. Hello. Paul
Erdos, 1913 to 1996, is one of the most celebrated mathematicians of the 20th
century. During his long career, he made a number of impressive advances in our
understanding of maths and developed whole new fields in the subject. Born into
a Jewish family in Hungary just before the outbreak of World War I, his life was
shaped by the rise of fascism in Europe, anti-Semitism and the Cold War. His
reputation for mathematical problem-solving is unrivaled and is extraordinarily
prolific. He produced more than 1,500 papers and collaborated with around 500
other academics. He also had an unconventional lifestyle. Instead of having a
long-term post at one university, he spent much of his life travelling around
visiting other mathematicians, often staying for just a few days. With me to
discuss the career of Paul Erdos are Timothy Gowers, Professor of Mathematics at
the College of France in Paris and Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge. Andrit
Legaun, Associate Professor in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham. And
Colva Rodi-Dugul, Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews.
Colva, would you start by telling us something about his early childhood? Sure.
He was born to a middle-class family in Budapest in March of 1913. Both of his
parents were high school teachers. They both taught maths and physics, his
mother and his father. And on some level, he should have been set for a pretty
comfortable existence. There were two particularly notable aspects of his early
childhood, though. So the first was that when she went in to hospital to give
birth to him, his mother already had two girls. He had two older sisters and a
wave of scarlet fever went through Budapest while she was in hospital. And as he
was being born, both of what would have been his elder sisters died. So this was
a deeply traumatic event for the whole family, as you can imagine, and meant
that his parents were very, very protective of him for all of his childhood
after that. By his own admission, he didn't butter his own bread until he first
arrived at Trinity College at the age of 21. And then the second really
significant event that happened early in his life was World War One broke out
and his father went off to fight in the war and was captured by the Soviets
almost immediately and didn't return for seven years. So he was in a very, very
intense relationship just with his mother from an early age. Then we had an
extreme right-wing government came to power in Hungary. And then what? What
happened to him? So his mother had briefly been promoted to headmistress by the
communist government just before the extremely right-wing one. And as a
consequence of that, she lost her job as a teacher when they came into power.
She still managed to make a living. She was tutoring him, but that meant she was
having to work quite hard going to different tutoring classes. And he was left
mostly in the care of a governess while she was out working. He said he taught
himself to count at the age of three by trying to count down the days until he
could see his mother for the daytimes again. And then as he went through his
childhood, various anti-Semitic laws were passed, of which probably the most
pertinent to him was one called numerous clauses, which restricted the number of
Jewish students at universities to 6%, which was roughly the proportion of the
population that was Jewish at the time, but was much, much less than what had
been the proportion of Jews going to university. So it was clear from a very
early age that it was going to be hard for him to have an academic career in
Hungary. There are these stories of his prodigious intelligence at the age of
three, at the age of five. I mean, somebody said he would say, give me a number,
and the man would say, four, five, six, seven, eight, and he would cube it. How
would you make of that? Is that taught or is that inherited? This idea is the
clearest idea I've come across of some genius just popping up. Or did it just
pop up? How does that happen? I think it must have just popped up in him. That
kind of facility with early calculation seems to be randomly distributed around
people. It's rare. It doesn't necessarily correlate with being good at maths
later on. But in his case, it most squarely did. He said that because he was
left alone by his parents so much, he just became obsessed with numbers as a way
of passing the time. Andrew, how did he begin to show, well, we've edged into
that, but how did he begin to show his mathematical talents so that others
besides his mother saw it? When his mum's friends came round, he would ask them,
how old are you? And he would then tell them how many seconds they'd lived for.
But then really, I guess the big breakthrough was when he was a teenager. So in
Hungary, they have this lovely culture of journals, so journals for high school
children. And in them, you'll have mathematical problems stated each month. Then
students would write in and give what they thought was the solution. And then in
the next month, the winners, the people that were correct, they would be
announced. So at that stage, Erdos was one of the most prolific problem solvers
in these high school journals, along with some other actually very good
mathematicians that turned out people like Paul Turan as well. So he sort of
made a name for himself as a problem solver, even in his teenage years. He took
a first class degree and his PhD at the same time, when he was about 17. Yeah,
so he went to university, the University of Budapest, aged 17. As you said, he
was doing them both simultaneously. And even at an early stage, he was doing
novel research. So he was often meeting other young mathematicians, people like
Paul Turan, George Sequeres. They're meeting in parks or they're going for
walks, and they were talking about mathematics, bouncing off each other, getting
ideas from each other. It was also a very significant point in his life, not
just in the sort of circle around Budapest, but also he made a name for himself
in the number theory community. So he wrote, well, just a couple of years after
that, but still during his undergraduate. So he reproved something called
Chebyshev's theorem. And Chebyshev's theorem was around since the 19th century,
but he gave a very elegant and simple and clever proof of this. Thank you very
much. Tim, can we have a little more detail about this theorem, Chebyshev's
theorem, and the difference between the old proof and the new proof that Dosh
came up with? Chebyshev's theorem concerns prime numbers. Those are numbers like
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, which don't have any factors apart from the obvious ones, 1, and
themselves. So for example, 9 is not a prime number because it's 3 times 3, but
11, you can only write it as 1 times 11, and so that is a prime number. If you
start asking yourself questions like, can you write a formula for the nth
largest prime number, it seems to be remarkably difficult. In fact, it's
generally believed now that there is no usable, sensible formula for the nth
largest prime number. Nth being? Nth just being some number. An arbitrary
number. So a formula that would tell you for any given integer, like a million
or a billion, what the millionth largest number is, or the billionth largest
number. It's not believed that such a formula exists. So instead, what we try to
do is look a little bit, stand back a little bit, and just ask ourselves
questions like, roughly how many primes are there between 1 and any given number
that you specify? Can you have a formula that just at least approximates the
number of primes? And Chebyshev, what he did was solve a problem known as
Bertrand's postulate, which had been posed five years earlier, which says that
between any number and twice that number, there must be a prime. Euclid had
already proved millennia earlier that there are infinitely many primes. So this
is a much more precise result. It says between any number and twice that number,
there must be a prime, which in particular implies that there must be infinitely
many primes. But Chebyshev's method was in some ways quite advanced. You need
quite a lot of mathematical expertise to read it. Erdos came up with a new proof
of Chebyshev's theorem, which I've read somewhere. It's described as something
that if you've got a maths A-level, you can understand this proof. There's a
word that mathematicians use, which is the word elementary. And elementary
doesn't mean easy, but it means it's built out of easy ingredients. So if you've
got the ingredients, if you've got the knowledge of an A-level student and a bit
of patience and willingness to try to understand this proof, then you can.
Whereas if you try to understand Chebyshev's proof, you have to have learnt
quite a lot more mathematics. Actually, you get a little bit more out of
Chebyshev's argument. You don't just get that there's a prime between n and 2n,
but you also get a reasonable estimate for how many primes there are up to any
given number. When I say reasonable, what I mean is you can say that it's at
least this number and at most twice that number, something like that. So it
narrows it down to within a factor of two, as we would say. Do you
mathematicians do this for the joy of it, like people are saying, or do you do
it because it has some end use? I would say both. So we do it for the joy of it,
but we're very fortunate in that quite a lot of what we do does eventually turn
out to have an end use. And so for that reason, people are prepared to, so to
speak, subsidize our hobby. Can you give us an end use? This is almost a cliched
example. Not all cliches are welcome. But number theory, of which this is an
example, and factorization and prime numbers and things, are absolutely
essential to the method of cryptography that we use in order to be able to do
transactions, financial transactions, safely online. So that's a very big
application of mathematics. But there are many, many others. Thank you. So he's
been to university, he's a starter, and he's going to do mathematics for the
rest of his life. And then he came across to Manchester University for four or
five years. What was that all about? So he'd been invited by a number theorist
called Mordell to go and work with the group in Manchester. His fame had become
quite great by this point. Isaac Asher, who's a wonderful number theorist, had
christened him the Wizard of Budapest for his skill. So it hadn't been so hard
for him to find a job. Since he was young, his parents had known that he would
have to leave Hungary. So the state of attacks on the Jewish population there
was such that it was clear he could never be an academic in Hungary. His mother
had suggested that maybe they should convert when he was seven. And he had
turned to her and said, you may do what you like, but I shall stay as I was
born, which is a statement from a seven year old, which is quite remarkable. So
they had made sure that he could speak English and French and German as well as
Hungarian. And he packed his bags and went off via Vienna and briefly stopping
in Trinity College, Cambridge and on to Manchester. Who did he work with in
Manchester that was important to him and to them? So Mordell was his boss in
Manchester. He did a lot of work with Hardy and Littlewood in Cambridge when he
was there. And he also started working on what became known later as the Erdos-
Karado theorem, but for strange reasons wasn't published until the 1960s. So he
started really cooking up this blend of number theory and combinatorics that was
to stay with him for the rest of his life while he was in Manchester. But it
wasn't that he only collaborated with people in Manchester. He started working
with everybody he could. Was this unusual? Yes, I would say so. So most of the
collaboration, I mean, yes, absolutely. So most people at the time mostly worked
on their own, whereas Erdos from a very early age possibly started by the walks
that Andrew's already mentioned around Budapest with his friends as an
undergraduate, loved to do maths with other people. He did do maths on his own,
but he strongly preferred to work with others. And he would go to Cambridge
often for the weekend. He was travelling all around Britain, working with
people. And at the end of three years, it was becoming increasingly clear that
Hitler was getting more and more dangerous and that he decided he needed to
leave Europe for good. So after a final visit back to Budapest in the summer of
1938, he charged back to London, got on the Queen Mary and set sail for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. And did he get anything else out of
the Manchester experience? That was when he first started getting interested in
lots of questions about what the numbers look like on average. So Tim's already
given us the definition of a prime number, which is a number that's only
divisible by one in itself. He got interested in the question of how many
different prime numbers divide a given number. So say, for example, 12 is only
divisible by two and three. Eight is only divisible by two. That's the only
prime that divides into eight. So that's got a score of one. Whereas if I go for
30, because that's two times three times five, that's got a score of three. And
so he got very interested in the question of not just is a number prime and can
I count the primes, but can I count how many dividers there are of a given
number? And he proved his first results in that direction while he was in
Manchester. And it was because of that and similar results that he was
eventually able to get the fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Studies,
which I should mention the pull factor as well as the push factors. It was
described as an intellectual paradise, the Institute for Advanced Studies. In
America? Yes, in America. So it was only five years old. Einstein was its first
professor. There were zero students, no teaching responsibilities. One could
just go there and do mathematics and theoretical physics to one's heart's
content. And John von Neumann, who's famous for many things, including work on
the nuclear bomb and game theory and economics, managed to get a fellowship for
Erdos to go and work there. And that financed him, did it? That financed him for
the first year. At the end of that first year, for reasons that are unclear, he
applied for a renewal and wasn't granted it. And Einstein argued strongly for
him to get a further job and said he had used strong words the like of which he
had not used before to try and enable Erdos to stay. But somehow he was deemed
not the right fit. And there were so many Jewish mathematicians coming over. Do
you have any clues to why he wasn't the right fit? I mean, he seems to do
mathematics all the time with mathematicians. And so what was he doing that
upset people? I think he was maybe a bit wild in some of his behaviour. It's, I
mean, I never met him. I'm just a bit too young to have done so. There's a quote
saying that Princeton didn't want to keep him because he was uncouth and
unconventional. So he was definitely unconventional in a sense that he would
speak his mind freely. There's stories about when he's talking with people, I
mean, this is a few years later, but talking with people to do with the
Manhattan Project in a restaurant, he loudly says, oh, how's the A-bomb going?
So he's very uncouth in that sense. It's a big thing for a man that intelligent,
backed by personal Einstein, to be kicked out, isn't it? Or am I? Yeah, of
course it is. Yeah. So is there any more reasons? I did meet him myself,
actually, but he was pretty old and I was quite young. And by that time, I think
he had sort of morphed into a sort of eccentric old man, not somebody that one
would, who would rub anybody up the wrong way. It is worth mentioning that, I
mean, this is now 1939 and the number of Jewish scientists and mathematicians
are attempting to get out of Europe and into America is very, very high. And
that's part of the reason why there's such competition for posts. Can you tell
us, give us some idea then when he gets to America, what does he start to work
on? I think he's working on a range of things at that stage. So he's interested
in something called discrete mathematics. What's that? So discrete mathematics
is the study of discrete mathematical objects. So what's a discrete mathematical
object? It's an object that in some sense is non-continuous or countable in some
sense. So if you look at the whole numbers, whole numbers, one, two, three,
four, and so on, that is countable. You can list the numbers as an ordering of
those numbers. It's also non-continuous in a sense that there's a gap between
one and two. There's a gap there. It's not a continuous thing. So there's a gap
between one and two, two and three, and so on. So he starts getting interested
in discrete mathematics. And this is a topic which is perhaps a bit
unfashionable at the time. He starts getting interested in things called graph
theory, so the study of networks. He's interested in Ramsey theory, which is the
study of complete disorder is impossible. So he was so driven by mathematics and
curious about different aspects of mathematics that he was willing to go out
there and work on problems that maybe weren't as fashionable to other
mathematicians. But America suited him and yet he had to leave it. So I guess
you're now talking about the 1950s. Yeah. Yeah. So it's kind of a bit
unfortunate. So he had a temporary position at the University of Notre Dame, as
the Americans call it. He actually was offered a permanent position there, but
he'd turned it down. He suited the nomadic lifestyle. At some stage he wanted to
go to Amsterdam to a conference and they refused him entry back into the US
again. Partly it's just because of the time it was. It was the McCarthy era of
the 1950s where America was just suspicious of foreigners, particularly from
communist countries. Also there was an FBI file on him. He was walking in Long
Island with some of the mathematicians and they didn't see the no trespassing
sign and they just were talking about math, wandered through to this military
transmitter and then they were sort of nabbed by the FBI and it was all cleared
up. But, you know, it created an FBI file on him and I think it was just an
excuse to get rid of him. So graph theory is being mentioned, Tim. Can you take
it in that direction? Certainly. The first thing to say is that there's an
unfortunate terminological clash, which is that the word graph, as used by most
people, means something you plot that shows how one thing depends on another. It
might be COVID cases as a function of time or something like that. But we're
talking here about when you're talking about graph theory, there's a completely
different meaning and a better word, but unfortunately not the word that most
people use, is the word that Andrew just mentioned, which is the word network.
So you can think of a graph as a bunch of points, which if you're using the
language of networks, you might call nodes. And some of the points are joined
together by lines which are known as edges. And that's all there is to a graph,
a bunch of points, some joined by edges. So you might ask, why is that
important? And the reason is that it can be, or one reason is that graphs can be
used to model a huge number of phenomena because the points, which we call
vertices, can represent objects of a certain kind and the lines joining them,
the edges, can represent potential relationships between them. So to give a few
examples, points could represent websites and you could join two points by an
edge if there's a link between those two websites. And then you get a graph that
is somehow modeling, in a certain sense, the structure of the internet. Or
points could represent people and you could join two points by an edge if those
two people are friends with each other and you get a sort of social network
modeled by a graph there. And then you also have graphs in pure mathematics. For
example, if you just take a shape like a cube and you look at it, it's got some
points, it's got the vertices of the cube, and some of those vertices are joined
by edges. So a cube is a graph, or can be thought of as a graph, with eight
vertices and twelve edges. So graphs have both an importance for modeling real-
life phenomena, which it often turns out that you can get a lot of insight into
the real world phenomena by forgetting all the details except this underlying
graph. And also they model various purely mathematical phenomena. He was a
problem solver, wasn't he, basically? Erdos was, yes. That was what he's maybe
mostly remembered for, as a supreme, not just problem solver, but also problem
poser. He asked a lot of questions, and the ones that he particularly liked, he
would offer monetary rewards for, which varied from something like, you know,
$30 all the way up to several thousand dollars, depending on how important or
difficult he thought the problem was. He gave money to so many good causes. He
gave away all the money he got, basically. And he didn't have much of that.
Yeah. He won the Wolf Prize and then just gave it, basically. He kept a little
bit that he needed to get from, sort of, to his next person who he was spending
the night with, and gave all the rest away. Yeah, it was $50,000, and he said he
kept $720. Colva, one of the fields of maths that he developed extensively was
Ramsey theory. So where you go? So, Ramsey theory starts with a particular
problem, which I'm very fond of, called the party problem. And I'll give the
first interesting instance of it as an example now. It says, how many guests do
you need to have at a party to guarantee that either at least three of them all
know each other, or at least three of them all don't know each other? So how big
a party do I have to have if I definitely want three friends that can stand in
the corner and catch up on gossip, or to find three people who've not met before
who can be introduced to each other? So I'm going to show you how to see that
six people is enough. So imagine that I'm hosting a party and I've invited five
friends. But maybe they're not my friends. We're interested in maybe them
knowing each other or not knowing each other. So these five people, they might
know me or not know me. So there's two possibilities and there's five of them.
So at least three of them must fall into one of the cases. It's not possible for
two of them to not know me and two of them to know me. The fifth person has to
go somewhere. So let's assume that three of them know me. I'll talk about the
other case afterwards. And think about those three people. So maybe the three of
you, guests at my party, and then you all know me. Then maybe two of you know
each other. And then the two of you plus me make three people that all know each
other. And if that's not the case, then no two of you know each other. And so
the three of you form three people that don't know each other. And so we managed
to do that with six people. If I'd said that at least three people didn't know
me, we would have swapped everything round. That's the first question of Ramsey
theory. And that shows that six people is enough if I want three to know each
other or not. So I can replace that three by any other number. I can say, I want
a party that's big enough for 17 people to all know each other or 17 to not. And
Frank Ramsey had proved that there always is a big enough party, no matter how
many people there's always a big enough party. Now, Erdős came along and firstly
found a much nicer, simpler, better way of proving that there's always a big
enough party and his bound on how many people you need at the party was smaller
than the previously known bound. He also was able to show a lower bound on how
many people. So a party size, which is definitely not big enough, using some
beautiful arguments, and essentially took what had been this single lone result
and turned it into an entire theory of mathematics, which people spend their
whole careers working on nowadays. Andrew, you want to come in? Yeah. So one
thing I wanted to say as well is that Ramsey theory isn't just about graphs and
about these parties, but actually this phenomenon occurs elsewhere in
mathematics. So Tim talked about one of Erdős's, about his open problem. So one
of his most famous open problems is the happy ending problem. And this is a
problem in Ramsey theory. Here, you, rather than looking at a party, you've got
a collection of points that you draw on a piece of paper. So imagine you draw
three points on a piece of paper, and as long as they're not in a straight line,
well those three points will be the corners of a triangle. Now what about if I
give you four points? Well those four points may not form a four-sided shape
because you can draw a triangle and then you can plop another point in the
middle and that's not a four-sided shape. It's not the corners of a four-sided
shape, what we call a convex quadrilateral. Actually you can ask this question
more generally, how many points do you need to put on a piece of paper such that
some of those points form your favourite, I don't know, pentagon, your six-sided
shape, your seven-sided shape and so on. What Erdős and George Szekeres showed
is actually these, there's always a solution to this problem. In a similar way
to the party problem, there is a solution. If you put enough points on a piece
of paper, you're going to get your n-sided shape somewhere in that picture. So
this was worked on 80 years ago by Erdős and Szekeres. They actually just asked
the question of what's the right answer, how small, how many points do you need
to put on a piece of paper such that as long as no three of them are in a line
then somewhere in that, n points will form the corners of an n-sided shape and
we don't know the answer even now, we don't know the exact answer. We know there
is some answer but we don't know exactly what it is. Do you think you ever will?
That's a tough one because actually that's a, very few problems in Ramsey theory
do we think that we're going to get an exact solution to. This is one where we
actually have a reasonably good, it's what we call an asymptotic solution. So as
n is large, if we're looking at an n-sided shape where n is large, we have a
reasonably good answer to it. But I think probably the answer is probably not
exactly. Can we go to, continue this Tim with you. We come up with the phrase
the probabilistic method. What's that about and what's its significance? Well I
think the easiest way to illustrate that is to go back to what Calder was saying
about the party problem and the question you can ask how many people do you need
in order to guarantee that some fixed number, be it 17 or 100 or whatever,
either all know each other or all don't know each other. If you want to show
that you need a lot of people then you've got to come up with some sort of
configuration of, or some sort of knowledge network so to speak or equivalently
some graph that demonstrates that you really do need a lot of people. And the
difficulty with the problem is that if you sit down and try to design this
person knows that person and this person doesn't know that person and so on,
it's incredibly difficult to write down a specification that demonstrates that
you really do need anything like as many people as the proof requires. And it
genuinely is very, very difficult to design this. Ehrlich had a brilliant idea
which was if it's difficult to design it, don't design it. What you do instead,
well it's called the probabilistic method, what you do instead is you just
choose your network entirely at random. So for each pair of people you toss a
coin, if it's heads they know each other, if it's tails they don't know each
other. And it turns out that if you do that then you can show that it's
extremely likely that you're going to need an absolutely huge number of people
before you get your specified number that either all know each other or all
don't know each other. This is very counterintuitive because you might think
that if almost everything works then surely you can just sit down and write down
something that will work. But unfortunately the set of things that you can
actually describe is a very small set. And so you can't sort of rule out that
all the ones you can describe happen to be the unfortunate ones that don't work.
So you know that almost everything works and this phenomenon actually occurs. So
what makes it particularly important is that it occurred in this one example.
But once you've seen this example it just changes the way you think as a
mathematician and then you start seeing this phenomenon all over the place.
There are many, many situations where it's very hard to describe a mathematical
object that has, explicitly, that has certain properties, but much easier just
to show that almost every object has those properties. It's a very strange
phenomenon but it's a very important one. And where does that lead you? For
Erdos it led to a lot of other solutions to problems in graph theory in other
areas where they had seemed extremely hard. But once you have this idea that
perhaps you could just try choosing a random object and seeing if that almost
always works, they become suddenly much easier. Picking up the word random,
Colma, random graph theory. Erdos was into that. What did he find there? What
did he do with it? So in a series of eight papers with Alfred Renni, who's
another Hungarian mathematician, Erdos and Renni invented the field of random
graph theory from scratch and proved that it was important. So the model that
they were imagining, they had two different ones but I'll talk about one in
particular, is that you pick some number of vertices and you pick a probability.
So maybe your probability is a half. And you look at all the possible pairs of
vertices and you put in each edge randomly with probability a half. And you ask
yourself, what can I say about the resulting graph? Is it possible, for example,
for me to walk along the edges from one vertex to any other? Or is it going to
break into different bits? Am I going to be able to colour the vertices with
some number of colours such that no two vertices sharing an edge are the same
colour? And this model of random graphs, they proved amazingly precise
properties about it, which I think Tim will tell us more about in a minute. But
it's turned out to be incredibly important for lots and lots of real world
applications. So for example, during the COVID pandemic, one of the models that
was used when trying to analyse if household bubbling could change over
Christmas, if one remembers that dark Christmas, was modelling our interactions
with each other as a random graph. We're all in households of between one and
about four people. And then somewhat randomly, we know people in other
households. And so if somebody in one household gets infected, probably
everybody in that household gets infected. But if they randomly meet with other
people, the infection might or might not spread along the edges in our graph of
knowing and not knowing. And that really does help to feed into questions about
whether or not we could meet each other. Do you want to develop that, Tim? Well,
just to say that, I suppose it gives another very good example of an application
of graph theory. It's another network. So the vertices there would be people and
the edges would be something like, you've joined two people by an edge, if they
come into close proximity. And sometimes you can do something a little bit more.
You can attach a weight to an edge. So you could say that maybe if two people
meet all the time because they live in the same house, you attach a high weight,
which means it's more likely that the disease will transmit. Whereas if they
just happen to meet each other in a shop while they're buying bread or
something, then there'd be an edge, but with much lower weight. So this weighted
graph is fundamental to the whole area of epidemiology. You can get a lot of
insight into how a disease spreads just from the graph theory. Andrew, he liked
to question himself, didn't he? Pose a problem for himself to solve as well as
finding problems that had not been fully solved to his satisfaction. Yes. So his
mantra was to prove and conjecture. So by conjecture, we mean pose open
problems. And it wasn't just for himself that he would pose problems. You know,
what he saw was that it was a duty of a mathematician to sort of lay the marker
points for other mathematicians to follow and say, this is an interesting
question. And as Tim mentioned earlier, he would often assign money to these
problems just to act as a guide. The more the problem was worth, the more
interested he was in the problem being solved. So actually, many of his problems
have been solved since he died. One example of this is, so we mentioned prime
numbers earlier. So one special case of one of his conjectures is that in prime
numbers, in a set of prime numbers, we know there's infinitely many, but inside
them, there are arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length. So what do I mean
by that? I mean, if you take an arithmetic progression is you start with some
number, and then you have a series of numbers whose differences are the same,
something like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, they all differ by three there. So that was, for
example, a special case of one of Erich's problems that was solved about 18, 19
years ago by Green and Tao. So if you've got a set of prime numbers, then
there's always going to be an arbitrary long arithmetic progression. So you can
go on forever finding this arithmetic progression. And that's quite
counterintuitive, actually, because, as was mentioned earlier, primes are kind
of sparse. There's infinite many, but they get less and less frequent, or the
density of them inside the whole numbers is less and less frequent. And to have
this regular structure, Erich was just great at posing problems. And I think
sometimes he was willing just to take a punt, and he would pose a question that
was just interesting to him. And sometimes it would pay off, and they would lead
to fruitful research directions. And sometimes they weren't necessarily paying
off. But the point was, he was so willing to go out there and pose problems,
that it's led to new directions emerging in mathematics. Here's another phrase I
only encountered the other day. Tim, that's a threshold, the threshold
phenomenon. That's a fascinating phenomenon that he observed in his work with
Alfred Rényi. Kolza mentioned the property of a graph. He called a graph
connected, if you can get from any vertex in the graph to any other vertex by
going along a path down some of its edges. They showed that if you start with no
edges at all, and then you just randomly put in an edge, and randomly put in
another edge, and randomly put in another edge, and you just keep on going like
that. And for a long time, the chances that the graph is connected, it's almost
certain that it won't be connected. Then you get to a certain point, the
threshold, and just beyond the threshold, it suddenly jumps from almost
certainly not being connected to almost certainly being connected. The point at
which you go from almost certainly not being connected to almost certainly being
connected just jumps extremely fast. And this is called the threshold
phenomenon. Do you know why that happens? Well, I do, but it's a sort of
complicated mathematical proof. I think the main thing to say is that this
phenomenon turns out to be extremely widespread, and it also occurs in physics.
In statistical physics, it would be known as a phase transition. The graph sort
of just suddenly goes from having one phase where it's not connected to another
phase where it is connected. There are many, there's also many open problems
concerning phase transitions. When you get a little bit more complicated than
the properties that Erdos and Rényi studied for graphs, you can get problems
that are very interesting and important. For example, there's a phenomenon
called the self-avoiding walk. That's a random walk in amongst points that never
visits itself twice, and that can model something like a long piece of DNA that
can't occupy the same point more than once, understanding various structures
that occur in chemistry and things like that. So understanding phase transitions
is very important. It's an interesting area where physicists would say that they
understand a lot more than mathematicians do, because mathematicians are looking
for completely rigorous proofs of these phenomena, whereas physicists are sort
of satisfied with slightly more heuristic arguments, let's say. Do we need to
say more about randomness in relation to number theory? Absolutely. So one of
the many fields which Erdos founded, and the one that he described himself as
being proudest of, is known as probabilistic number theory. Now number theory is
about properties of the whole numbers, and the bit of it he was most interested
in is this question of divisibility by primes that's come up a few times before
now. And it doesn't seem like randomness should have anything to do with it. I
mean, the fact that 12 is 2 times 2 times 3 is not random, that's set in stone.
But together with a Polish mathematician, Marc Kacz, they worked out that if,
rather than looking at individual numbers and asking how many different primes
divide a number, they started looking at large sets of numbers, say all the
numbers up to a million, or all the numbers up to a million million, and asked
how many primes divided all of them, and looked at the count, and drew a graph
of it, say, not graph in the sense of vertices and edges, but graph in the sense
of like a bar chart, say, the resulting chart winds up looking just like the
bell curve histogram that we see across all sorts of real world things. So were
you to toss a coin a thousand times and record the number of heads and tails,
and then do it again, and do it again, and do it again, and record how many
heads you got, on average, you'd expect to get about 500 heads, but you wouldn't
get perfectly 500 heads every time. You'd get mostly 500, some 499, some 501,
some slightly fewer 502, and so on. And it would come down in that lovely bell-
shaped curve that I'm sure lots of our listeners have seen in many contexts. He
discovered that we get a curve like that when we ask about the number of prime
divisors. And it's kind of incredible. I put my little laptop to work coming
down yesterday on the train and asked it to do this count for me for all the
numbers up to a million. And his formula predicts that the average number of
prime divisors should be between 2 and 3, a bit closer to 3 than 2. Now, you
can't have 2 and 1 half prime divisors, of course. So what my computer returned
to me was that the most common answer was 3, and then shortly after that was 2,
and then shortly after that was 4, and then there's a few primes and powers of
primes, and then 5 and 6 and 7 were the smallest numbers. There's only seven
numbers less than a million that are divisible by seven primes. So even at a
million, I could see this kind of bell curve phenomena beginning. And nobody had
thought of mixing probability and divisibility by primes like that before. And
once you've got the idea of doing that, you can ask all sorts of other
questions, too. Tim, he's seen as more of a problem solver than a theory
developer. Do you agree with that? I do. It's a distinction which is more a
matter of emphasis than an absolute distinction, because if you look at the
problems that he posed, once you start thinking about them, they may just look
like a whole lot of isolated problems, but once you actually start thinking
about them, you realize that there are difficulties, quite deep difficulties
associated with the problems, and that in order to solve the problems, you're
forced to come up with ideas. You suddenly get a sense that Erdos, these
problems hadn't come out of nowhere, they'd come out of some quite deep thought.
Nevertheless, it is the case that there is a contrast between the way different
mathematicians operate. And some would say that what they're really trying to do
is improve their understanding, and if they improve their understanding, then
solving problems will be a consequence of that. And others, and Erdos is more
like the other kind, would say that what they really want to do is solve
problems. By solving problems, they will improve understanding. There was a very
nice metaphor of the mathematician Alexander Grotendieck, who said that he
considered the idea of a nut, you want to open a nut. Two approaches, one is you
get a nutcracker and you squeeze as hard as you can until the nut breaks and
then you've got inside. Grotendieck's preferred approach was to put the nut into
some sort of liquid and just leave it there for a very, very long time until the
shell softened and it opened very easily. So Grotendieck regarded himself as
more of a theory builder, somebody who wants his understanding to improve until
problems get solved easily. And I think Erdos was more of the other kind, where
he just wanted to go straight in and directly attack problems. Yeah, he had a
lovely discussion of the problems he posed himself, and he said some of them
were like marshmallows in that they were incredibly tasty to solve, but dissolve
on your mouth quite quickly afterwards and leave not much left. Whereas others
were like acorns in that trying to solve them could produce the roots of a huge
mathematical tree. So I think he himself was aware of these different ways
problem solving could go. Andrew, can you tell us, we're getting towards the end
now, what's an Erdos number? Yeah, so an Erdos number is a bit of mathematical
fun really. We like to measure our distance as mathematicians from Erdos. So if
you are Paul Erdos, you have an Erdos number of zero. If you've written a paper
with Paul Erdos, you have an Erdos number of one. If you've written a paper with
someone that's written a paper with Erdos, you have an Erdos number of two and
so on and so forth. So to put in some context, because Erdos had about 500 co-
authors, there's about 500 people with an Erdos number of one. Already there's
more than 10,000 people with an Erdos number of two. And it's not just
mathematicians. So Albert Einstein has an Erdos number of two, for example. So
most mathematicians have an Erdos number somewhere between one and five. And
actually, you know, it's not that impressive to have a small Erdos number. I'd
be more impressed with finding someone with an Erdos number of 10, a
mathematician, because I would wonder how did they get that far removed from
Erdos' work. So each of you, what's your Erdos number and what does it mean?
Starting with you, Colma. Well, my PhD supervisor, Peter Cameron, collaborated
with Erdos, and I have since published with my PhD supervisor. So my Erdos
number is two. Likewise, I have an Erdos number of two. So I worked with a
mathematician called Sasha Kostoska, who happened to work with Erdos. So that's
my Erdos number as well. And mine should be two because my supervisor was a
close collaborator of Erdos. But actually, I've never had a joint paper with my
supervisor. So for a long time, it was four. And then a few years ago, it went
down to three. I collaborated with someone who collaborated with someone who
collaborated with Erdos. It's a it's a crass question to ask. Just as a matter
of interest, how do you rate him? I think the biggest compliment I can make as a
discrete mathematician, as a combinatorialist, is that it's very hard to work on
a problem and not be influenced by Erdos. So what I'll do when I'm approaching a
problem is I'll try and do things randomly, I'll do the probabilistic method or
think, oh, is there some Ramsey type behaviour here? So as as someone working in
his field, I think on a weekly, on a monthly basis, I'm influenced by him. So in
that sense, he was incredibly important. I would say the same. I also work in
very much sort of Erdos style mathematics. You can't escape his influence, nor
would you want to because he had such amazing ideas. I'd like to, yeah, I mean,
echo the previous two remarks, but also say quite apart from his mathematical
influence, I think this collaborative style of doing mathematics really has
changed maths for the good. Most of my research is in collaboration with other
people. It's made being a mathematician a completely different thing from what
it might have been before him. And it might have tended that way anyway. But his
his fondness for collaboration, his support of lots of female mathematicians who
he worked with, and his insistence on beauty in mathematics and finding joy in
mathematics have really changed it for all of us. There was a lovely limerick
about him, which I'd love to tell, which he was delighted by. So a mathematical
conjecture, both deep and profound, asserts that a circle is round. In a paper
by Erdos, written in Kurdish, a counter example is found. And Erdos was so
pleased by this, he tried to publish a paper in Kurdish, but unfortunately
couldn't find a journal to do so. But that sense of playfulness and joy in what
we do is a wonderful thing to have left the rest of us. Well, that was terrific.
Thank you very much. I'll have to listen to it several times, but still. Thank
you very much. Thanks Colva Roneadugl, Andrew Treglone and Timothy Gowers, and
our studio engineer, Jackie Marjoram. Next week, Megaliths, the stone monuments
first built in Britain around 6,000 years ago. Thank you for listening. In Our
Time with Melvin Bragg is produced by Simon Tillotson. Continuing our
celebration of the centenary of BBC radio drama. The huntsman now purposefully
erected his footsteps. Analyzing the most groundbreaking plays from the vast
drama archive. It's intensely physical, this room. He just took your wallet,
sir. You can go to different places and tell the stories from different points
of view. It beats with me, Michael Simmons-Roberts. Everything in British
storytelling, film, television, owes so much to radio drama. On Radio 4 and BBC
Sounds on Saturday night at 8. Now on Radio 4, our book of the week. Today in
Catherine Rundell's biography of John Donne. A tricky start to a relationship
that fuelled some of the most desire-filled poetry in the English language. Jake
Ritson reads Super Infinite. Who was she? Anne Moore. The very young woman with
whom the complicated, furious, funny poet was so in love. We know very little.
We do not even know how she preferred to spell her own name, as with the
capriciousness typical of the period, she is spelled Anne both with and without
an E. It was her second name, though, that Donne played on over and over. As
much more loving, as more sad. He first met her, the third daughter of Sir
George Moore, when she was only about fourteen years old, and he was working as
a secretary in Thomas Edgerton's household. She had been sent to London to learn
the ways of the city and the court, and something in her face or manner
bludgeoned John Donne in the heart. Given her father's wealth, she was likely to
have been fashionable, and her clothes would have been good. Stitching elaborate
needle lace was the rage, and necklines were having a moment of extremes, either
rising high to the chin or scooped so low they skated close to the nipple. But
his poetry never describes her clothes or her body. Donne's metaphors are vivid,
wild, evocative, and potent, but they are strikingly unspecific. It never
occurred to him to tell us if she curved at the hip, or jutted at the
collarbone, or was taller than him. Presumably it was not what was important.
The hunger and the body itself were what mattered. Perhaps to look for Anne in
Donne's verse is to misunderstand what the poems are doing. They're not
representations of her, but representations of him. Him watching her, needing
her, inventing for her. They are trumpet blasts across a hard land, more than
they are portraits. In a valediction of My Name in a Window, written in 1599,
Donne imagines etching his name with a diamond ring on a window, and his lover
seeing her own reflection and his name intermingled. Tis much that glass should
be as all-confessing and through-shine as I. Tis more that it shows thee to thee
and clear reflects thee to thine eye. But all such rules love's magic can undo.
Here you see me, and I am you. Her willingness to defy her father was a
remarkable thing. She must have had in her a flash of daring in a world that
insisted on obedience. She could only have met Donne in secret, and secret
places were not easy to find. They might have been able to collide under the
plausible deniability of public spaces, parks, popular walks, church. They might
have attended events in the evening, pageants, which could be so crowded that
silk-clad bodies would press against each other. She took vast risks for him,
larger than he took for her, spurred on by desire, or perhaps by Donne's urgent
importuning, or by the wild optimism of youth. She risked gossip, scandal, and,
perhaps at the very end, pregnancy. They may well have been lovers in the weeks
before they wed, hiding behind insouciant faces and very careful timing. She
gave a great, recklessly romantic leap into the dark. The landing was not to be
a soft one. Was he worth the sacrifice when she forswore the thousand easier
futures that surrounded her? The alternatives would have been right in front of
her. She could have aimed for a life more like that of her cousin by marriage,
Elizabeth, who had, that year, been married off to Baron Hastings, with all the
castles and gardens and wall-hangings embroidered with unicorns that that
involved. What was Donne that she decided to risk her father's wrath in order to
share his days, his small income, his bed? If he took her to bed like he wrote,
if he knew how to render bodily his poetry, then he was worth sacrificing all
the wall-hangings in England for. To read him, to read all of his love-poems
together is to feel yourself change, for his is a passion which acknowledges the
strangeness you are born with. His best poetry is a triumphant call of desire,
sincerity, joke, all bound into one. It's there, for instance, in A Valediction
Forbidding Morning. The lovers are imagined as the two feet of a pair of
mathematical compasses joined eternally at the base. If they be two, they are
two so. As stiff twin compasses are two, thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
to move but doth if thither do. And though it in the centre sit, yet when
thither far doth roam, it leans and hearkens after it, and grows erect as it
comes home. It is so extravagantly witty, and so riotously plays only by its own
rules, it needed to be clever, because he demands that sex be intelligent. It's
the poem of a man who has the temerity and invention to see the human condition
in a piece of metal. It loves the body, because Dunne, unlike so many of the
highbrow poets who went before him, never pretended not to have a body. Grows
erect as it comes home is a pun so obvious it might as well be a little sketch
of a penis. But it is fundamental to his love poetry that the body Dunne
imagines isn't just a body. It transforms and becomes simultaneously other
things, a world, a state, a city, a planetary sweep. The lover looks at the
woman in The Good Morrow and sees a world atlas. Where can we find two fitter
hemispheres without sharp north, without declining west? In To His Mistress
Going to Bed, the woman's girdle becomes a constellation of stars, and her body
is the entire world. Off with that girdle like heaven's zone glistering, but a
far fairer world encompassing. And again, My kingdom safeliest when with one man
manned. And the man in The Sun Rising chides the rising sun, declares, She all
states and all princes I, she becomes the world. Since thy duties be to warm the
world, that's done in warming us. Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere.
This bed thy centre is, these walls thy sphere. Some of that woman as state,
woman as world is Dunne working in a tradition, but some of it was personal.
Dunne's relentless imagination was his single most constant feature. His mind
had ceaselessness built into it. It was to be, throughout his life, a site of
new images, new theology, new doubts. Even those who disliked his work
acknowledged that he was a writer who had erupted through the old into the new.
But the always of that imagination must have been exhausting. For a mind like
that, sex, real sex, true sex, would allow a singleness to hush the
multitudinous mind. It's why so much of Dunne's imagery around sex is so
totalizing. The man and woman become one, the woman becomes a state, a country,
a planet. Sex for Dunne and those like him, permission for those who watch the
world with such feverish care to turn one person into the world and to watch
only them. It was a transforming of his constant seeking for knowledge. To adore
and to devour and to be devoured is its own kind of focus, a gasp of a different
kind of oxygen. And so they married. The wedding took place about three weeks
before Christmas in 1601, according to Dunne. It was very small, no more than
five guests. After the wedding, Anne returned to her family home, Lowsley Park,
in the countryside with her oblivious father, as if nothing had happened, and
Dunne went back to his lodgings to wait and hope. To hope for what, beyond a
good moment to break the news, is hard to say. The moment didn't come. So in the
end, on the 2nd of February, almost two months after the wedding day, he wrote a
letter and sent it to his father-in-law via the 9th Earl of Northumberland,
Henry Percy. It wasn't by any reckoning a good letter. Dunne was aiming for both
humility and authority. He instead succeeded in sounding at once over-confident
and mildly unhinged. I knew my present estate less than fit for her. I knew, yet
I knew not why, that I stood not right in your opinion. I knew that to have
given any intimation of it had been to impossibilitate the whole matter. I know
this letter shall find you full of passion, but I know no passion can alter your
reason and wisdom, to which I adventure to commend these particulars, that it is
irremediably Dunne—he spells it D-O-N-N-E, a fantastically inappropriate pun on
his own name—that if you incense my lord, you destroy her and me, that it is
easy to give us happiness, and that my endeavours and industry, if it please you
to prosper them, may soon make me somewhat worthier of her. Its multiple
requests rolled up in one—daughter and a job and forgiveness. From the point of
view of George Moore, with his notoriously quick temper and his aspirations to
nobility, it was a disaster. Anne might have formed a great alliance, have given
him titled in-laws with whom to socially machinate. Now she had bound herself to
a scribbling reprobate without property and with a dead religious traitor for
brother, so George went immediately to Dunne's employer, Thomas Edgerton. Anne
was still a minor, so Dunne had broken canon law. The case went to the city's
commissioners. Dunne was summarily dismissed from Edgerton's household, and to
his bewilderment thrown into the Fleet Prison to await further investigation.
The Fleet Prison was simultaneously disgusting and expensive. A debtor's prison,
it didn't have the dignity and royal tinge of the Tower. It stood on the banks
of the River Fleet in East London, and had a grill looking on to the street
through which prisoners could beg for alms. Prisons were profit-making
enterprises. You paid for each turn of the key, paid to have your irons removed,
paid for your food and lodging. Dunne's brother had died in one prison. Now he
was in another, and like Henry he was growing increasingly desperately unwell.
On the 11th of February, locked in his cell, he wrote a more desperate plea to
Sir George. He no longer stood upon his pride. And though, perchance you intend
not utter destruction, yet the way through which I fall towards it is so
headlong that being thus pushed I shall soon be at bottom. I have no refuge but
that of mercy which I beg of him, my Lord, and you. This new, humbler letter
asked more to think of Anne. Dunne's fall from nuptial rebellion to obeisance
was very swift, fast enough to overturn his whole understanding of what you
could and couldn't talk your way around. Sir George sent word in return that he
would leave the matter up to Edgerton, who ordered that Dunne should be allowed
to return to his lodgings. He stayed there, under house arrest in dark
midwinter, while the legality of his marriage to Anne was decided. Dunne's
health began to improve, but his life was still in chaos. While the High
Commission deliberated, he continued to send out flocks of letters. Some were to
Sir George. In one he reiterated his passion for Anne and begged permission to
send a note to her. Very slowly, George Moore began to come round. On the 27th
of April, 1602, the Court of Audience declared Dunne's marriage good and
sufficient. It was a very unambiguous victory. A true and pure marriage, it was
declared, had been contracted between the said Anne Moore, alias Dunne, and John
Dunne. Dunne was at last allowed to take up his wife.
