BBC News at 11 o'clock. Police in Northern Ireland say the investigation into
the shooting of one of their officers in County Tyrone is focusing on a
dissident Republican group, the new IRA. Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell
was attacked outside a sports complex in Oma last night. He is in a critical
condition in hospital. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Page says the gunman
confronted Mr Caldwell as he left the venue. He had been coaching football at
this sports complex last night. He had been putting footballs into his car, in
fact with his young son and two gunmen approached and opened fire. The detective
ran a short distance, he fell on the ground and the gunmen continued to shoot
him. So he was taken to hospital in London Derry. His condition is described as
critical but stable. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, says his party wants
to give Britain its confidence back. In a speech in Manchester, Sir Keir is
setting out Labour's five missions for government, which include making the UK
the highest growth economy in the G7. Doctors at a hospital in London have
published guidance on how to treat the severe side effects of inhaling nitrous
oxide after a surge in people admitted with symptoms over the past year. They
are warning that the drug, also known as laughing gas, can cause permanent
damage to nerves in the spinal cord. The number of asylum seekers waiting for a
decision on their case in the UK has risen to record levels with around 166,000
people in the backlog. Almost 110,000 have been waiting for longer than six
months. The government has announced plans for the first independent regulator
of men's football in England. The body will be able to stop teams joining
breakaway leagues that it thinks could damage the domestic game. The football
commentator John Motsen has died at the age of 77. Known to fans as Mottie, he
covered 10 World Cups and European Championships as well as 29 FA Cup finals
during a 50-year career with the BBC. BBC News In half an hour here on Radio 4,
we continue our series of reflections from actors across the world who've all
played the same part. Today, the magical role of Peter Pan. But is there a dark
side to playing the boy who never grows up? Role play is at half past eleven.
But first, it's time for From Our Own Correspondent, presented by Kate Aidee.
Good morning. Today, we look back at events last February. As Western capitals
eyed a Russian troop build up on Ukraine's border, our Russia editor reflects on
what followed. One and a half million Ukrainian refugees flooded across the
border to Poland after Russia's invasion. What does life look like now for those
that left? Amid heavy preparations for a trip by US President Joe Biden to
Europe this week, we hear how American reporters were wrong-footed by his
surprise emergence in Kiev. And we hear from a Ukrainian journalist about how a
phone call turned his world and those of his friends and family upside down.
First, we're in the Donbas region, where nearly ten years ago, conflict began
with Russia's annexation of Crimea. During that war, Russian proxy forces
captured more than a third of Ukraine's east, claiming more than 14,000 lives.
Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of the 24th of February
last year served as a dramatic escalation, targeting the capital city Kiev and
unleashing havoc on cities across Ukraine. A few months into the war, the
Russian president set his sights on the more limited declared aim of liberating
the Donbas, bombarding cities in eastern Ukraine. The battle there rages on.
Oleg Eren was in Donbas at the start of the 2022 invasion, and says the terror
of those early days has become a way of life for people in the east. The sound
of an explosion shook me from my sleep. It was just after five in the morning on
the 24th of February last year. I was in eastern Ukraine in a quirky hotel
called the Europa, which had a different European flag hanging outside each
room. I heard the thunder of feet as fellow journalists headed for the door,
some charging off to film, others trying to get away to safety. Then, as now, no
one could be sure where that might be. By two that afternoon, Viktor had signed
up to defend his country, thinking the war would be over by summer. The 39-year-
old husband and father, who has a wispy beard, used to run an online shoe
business. Now he's part of a mortar team. We met recently in a bunker on the
outskirts of the embattled eastern city of Bahmut, where the enemy is close and
the cold bone deep. Since the invasion, he hasn't been able to visit his wife
and two sons. The youngest was just six months old when he left. He was so
little when I went to war, Viktor tells me. Now when I make a video call home,
he sees my face and doesn't know who I am. Viktor believes this war won't end
with Vladimir Putin. With or without him, Russia will keep coming here, trying
to take our land, he says. We have to finish this now so that our sons and
daughters don't have to fight in the future. And there's another reason why he's
staying in the line of fire. For the brothers in arms, he has lost. He doesn't
give numbers, but says there are many, very many. Grief, too, cuts to the bone.
Just ask any Ukrainian. My Facebook is like a cemetery, our local producer told
me. I have lost six friends in the past year. Like him, they were young men.
Ukraine has legions who will never grow old. A few hours' drive from Bapmut, I
met the commander of a tank unit. Over a platter of cheese sandwiches, he
rattled through the latest developments on the battlefield. But his armor
cracked when I asked how difficult it was to fight for so long. It's hard, he
told me, when a 152-caliber shell explodes ten meters away from you. It's hard
when you are pressed against the wall by the blast wave. It's hard when you take
a soldier to the hospital, picking up his severed arms and legs. The horrors
here extend well beyond the battlefield. Anastasia used to be a mother of two.
Last September, Russia made her a mother of one. She was in the local park with
her twin boys, Ruslan and Denise. They were nine then, energetic, outdoorsy, and
always side by side. Suddenly, as they played, there was shelling and a wave of
shrapnel. Denise was hit. At the hospital, Ruslan fell on the floor, Anastasia
says, and started kissing the doctor's feet. He said, I beg you, save my
brother, there is no one like him. Who will I go for walks with? Who will I
celebrate my birthday with? But Denise did not survive. Anastasia weeps
endlessly as she tells me about that day. Ruslan stands nearby, in silence, dry-
eyed. His grief is locked inside. That piece of Russian shrapnel will follow him
through life. When I came back to the East this month, I checked into a hotel in
the town of Drushkivka. A few nights after I arrived, three Russian missiles
came slamming to Earth, about half a mile away, with the kind of impact that
reverberates in your body. I listened for any reaction in the hotel. No one ran
for the door. One year on, terror is the new normal here. Among Ukrainians,
there is unity and determination, but some have annoying fear. I don't think we
are even in the middle of this war, a Ukrainian journalist told me, fresh from
the front line. They have a lot more men, and even if their weapons are not
sophisticated, they still kill. Oleg Heron On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin took to
the stage to make his annual State of the Nation address in Moscow, a speech in
which he blamed the West for escalating the war, and accused the US and its
allies of seeking limitless power. In an escalation of his own, he then
announced the suspension of a nuclear arms treaty. The move raises the stakes
once more, in a conflict which has frequently put NATO powers on alert. What's
hard to anticipate is how far Vladimir Putin is willing to go to win the war,
and that's been the problem from the outset, says Steve Rosenberg. I admit it. I
was wrong. Up until the 24th of February last year, I had believed, or perhaps
I'd wanted to believe, that despite all of its problems, post-Soviet Russia had
undergone an irreversible transformation. One that would rule out a future
conflict with the West, walk around Moscow, and what did you see? American
coffee shops, British retail chains, Swedish furniture stores. As long as
Russians were flocking to Ikea and hanging out at Starbucks, surely world peace
was guaranteed. And then there were the holidays. Paris, Rome, Barcelona, post-
communism, Europe was a popular destination for Russian travellers, and the
continent of choice for oligarchs and officials selecting schools for their
kids. Surely, over time, that would help cement Western values in Russian
society. True, there were worrying signs. An increasingly authoritarian Kremlin,
Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and anti-Western rhetoric was on the
rise. But as long as Russians could access the internet and alternative sources
of information, surely I thought they would distinguish between reality and
propaganda, and realise that despite what their leaders were telling them,
Russia was not a besieged fortress, and that the West was not plotting to
destroy their country. Well, one year after Russia launched its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, the American coffee shops have gone, the Ikea stores have
shut. Yes, the internet's still working here, and although many websites, like
the BBC's, have been blocked, it is still possible to access alternative voices
online if you're prepared to search for them. Truth is, most Russians are not.
For many here, state media suffices. Which brings me to what has shocked me most
about Russia the last 12 months. The first thing is the ease with which so many
Russians accept the propaganda on state TV, and then repeat it almost word for
word. Many people here have said to me, Russia didn't invade Ukraine, the West
started this. Russia never starts wars, it only ends them. In Belgorod, near the
Ukrainian border, Olga, who runs a church choir, recently told me this. Russians
are peace-loving and generous. A Russian will give you the shirt off his back.
He will never attack you, he will protect you. After the death and destruction
Russia has wrought, I'm sure the people of Ukraine would disagree with Olga.
Then there's the aggression. On the same trip to Belgorod, a market seller told
me that Ukrainians need to be re-educated, remade, to force them to like Russia.
But the comment that shocked me most was from a Muscovite called Viera. I
interviewed her last September at a pro-Putin rally near the Kremlin. I'd rather
my son was killed fighting in Ukraine, said Viera, than see him getting up to
mischief at home. Look how many young men here have no job and spend their time
getting drunk. A few weeks later, President Putin himself echoed that sentiment
when he spoke to the mother of a pro-Russia fighter killed in the Donbass. We
all have to die sometime, the president said. What's important is how you spent
your life. Some people die from vodka and their lives pass unnoticed, but your
son really lived. Is that the choice now for Russian men? Die from alcohol or
die on the battlefield? What does that say about the state of Russia after 23
years of Putin in power? It was after speaking to Viera that I realized how
naive I'd been. Most Russians couldn't care less about hopping off to Paris or
London. They're too busy struggling to survive in Voronezh or Penza and dealing
with alcohol abuse, domestic violence that is so widespread here. For some of
them Vladimir Putin's special military operation has proved a financial boost.
Last November President Putin ordered a one-off payment of 195,000 rubles,
that's just over $3,000, for mobilized troops and contract soldiers. Others here
see war as a path to gaining respect from their peers and from their state. I
will never forget what a woman called Valia told me about her husband, a
convicted killer. In prison he had been recruited to fight in Ukraine by the
private military company Wagner. He had told Valia the motherland needs
defending. From whom, Valia had replied, no one's attacked us. Her husband
explained. Now I'm a prisoner, but I will return a hero. Steve Rosenberg. The
decision by US President Joe Biden to visit Kiev early this week was a high-risk
maneuver aimed at showing unity with Western allies. Sirens wailed as President
Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, appeared in public
together at St. Michael's Cathedral in the center of the capital. After the
visit, Washington announced more than $450 million worth of security and
emergency assistance for the country. But although President Biden pledged to
back Ukraine for as long as it takes in the conflict, there are signs on the
fringes of Congress that support his beginning to waver back home, says Sarah
Smith. An oy a bunch of journalists, and they will always make their feelings
known, probably pretty loudly. And nothing annoys journalists more than missing
a big story. So it was a very disgruntled bunch of hacks I met at Andrews Air
Base just outside Washington to fly to Warsaw on Monday evening, and that was
many hours after President Biden had already made his surprise visit to Kiev.
Everyone was complaining about being left out and misled by the White House
officials who had been telling us for days there were no plans for POTUS, the
President of the United States, to enter Ukraine. They had succeeded in keeping
his visit a secret, despite much speculation among the press corps about whether
the President would set foot in Ukraine during his visit to Poland. So the first
I knew about it was when I woke up in Washington on Monday morning, by which
point he was already in Kiev. Only two reporters had been sworn to secrecy and
allowed to travel with the President on a small C-32 aircraft and then a 10-hour
train ride. Of course, the surprise nature of the visit did add enormously to
the impact it had. Many other world leaders have made the trip to Kiev, but it
is almost unheard of for a US President to appear in a war zone in a country
that doesn't have a strong American military presence there to provide security.
The optics, as they call them in America, were clearly designed to send the
message that Mr Biden is totally committed to supporting Ukraine for the long
term. And that message was aimed at an American audience at home just as much as
it was meant for the people of Ukraine. Because whilst the President insists he
will back Ukraine for as long as it takes, some politicians on the far right and
left of American politics have started to question how much longer the US can
afford to keep sending weaponry. An opinion poll suggests public support is
slipping too. The last time Presidents Biden and Zelensky met was on another
surprise visit to Washington just before Christmas. On that occasion Mr Zelensky
received a rapturous welcome when he addressed both houses of Congress. He was
dressed in his familiar khaki fatigues and surrounded by elected representatives
dressed in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag. There were many
lengthy standing ovations, but it was noticeable that some of the more Trump-
aligned representatives stayed in their seats and over half of the House
Republicans didn't turn up at all. Donald Trump Jr clearly thought he was
reflecting the mood of the MAGA or Make America Great Again crowd when he
tweeted back then that Zelensky is basically an ungrateful welfare queen. This
week his father, the former President, has repeated his claim that Putin would
never ever have gone into Ukraine if he was still in office. The hard right
Republican representative from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, has said not a
penny more of American money should be spent on Ukraine. She argues the cash
would be much better used trying to stop immigration and drug imports at the US-
Mexican border, but claims the only border the Democrats care about is
Ukraine's. These kind of views are currently aired only by a small minority of
elected US politicians, and there aren't nearly enough votes in Congress yet to
prevent President Biden sending more money to Ukraine or even fighter jets if he
decides to. But there are doubts growing on the left as well, where activists
complain that they don't see any attempts to broker a diplomatic solution.
People leaders do still support President Biden on Ukraine, even if they don't
agree with him on anything else. When the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch
McConnell, posted a picture of himself with President Zelensky, he proclaimed
supporting Ukraine is morally right and a direct investment in cold hard
American interests. So the President need not worry too much yet about domestic
dissent, and he certainly doesn't care about the complaints from grumbling
journalists here that Moscow was informed of his impeachment. Now the plane, by
the way, that special 747 that usually carries the President, is not known as
Air Force One when he's not on board. So I travelled to Warsaw on a flight that
was designated Special Air Mission 28, which does still sound quite cool, I
suppose. Sarah Smith. Images from station platforms in Ukraine a year ago showed
vast throngs of people fleeing the Russian invasion, confused and chaotic scenes
as women and children boarded trains often to an unknown destination, forced to
say goodbye to husbands and fathers who were required to stay behind. Poland
welcomed the largest number of refugees and continues to host almost a million,
though many went on to countries across Europe, including Germany and the UK. In
the early days of the war, Sarah Rainsford was in eastern Ukraine where she saw
people fleeing in terror. This month she's been in eastern Poland, where
refugees are still arriving, but the mood has changed. When the evening train
from Kiev pulls into eastern Poland, it can be hard to spot the refugees now.
Among the passengers stepping onto the platform are young Ukrainians with a
connecting train to Prague. They're mostly smart women with wheelie bags who
could be from anywhere, until you ask them and they tell you they've come for a
few days break from all the air raids. But other Ukrainians are still fleeing as
refugees. I met Olga and Alexander at an abandoned Tesco supermarket that's been
turned into a transit hub for Ukrainians arriving in Poland. They'd just been
registered and allocated camp beds in a corner near a family with a French
bulldog. The couple's story was one of occupation and separation, injury and
death. It's the kind I've heard hundreds of times this past year, the kind I
never imagined I'd hear before last February 24th. When Russian soldiers
surrounded Olga's village, her husband was in Kiev and they ended up apart for
many weeks. She had no power from day one and no running water. But when I asked
how the Russians had treated people there, Olga told me it wasn't like Vucher,
the key of suburb that's now associated with torture and murder by the invading
troops. She sounded apologetic as if she'd got off lightly. But under
occupation, her elderly mother died of gangrene without proper medical help.
Olga had to wrap her body in a blanket because there were no coffins and drag
her to the cemetery on a sledge. Her eyes fill with tears, but she blinks them
back. She wants to talk and when she does, I discovered that her own house was
destroyed and she was nearly killed too. When her street was shelled, a
neighbour landed on top of her, badly hurt by shrapnel. All of this was back in
March. In May, Ukrainian forces managed to free Olga's village and she and
Alexander were reunited. So I asked the couple why they were leaving Ukraine now
and they said they were scared that Vladimir Putin was planning something even
more wretched to mark the first anniversary of his invasion. The lady next to
them in the shelter told me the same. She'd also brought her son out of Ukraine
because he was about to turn 18 and she couldn't bear to see him called up to
fight. All the best, most handsome lads in our town have been taken, she told
me. And she meant killed. Her name was Olga too. We spoke in Russian because
that's her first language. Another reminder that when President Putin says he's
invading Ukraine to save Russian speakers from persecution, in reality they're
fleeing his shelling and his bombs. At the start of the war, we were reporting
from near the Donbas region in the east. The goodbyes on the station platform
there were heartbreaking. I remember fathers with their hands pressed to the
glass of the evacuation trains, women and children mouthing silent words on the
other side, grown men turning away quickly to hide their tears. Today the panic
and shock I saw then have been replaced by depression, a weary realisation that
life inside Ukraine won't get much better any time soon. That's why Olga and
Alexander and the other Olga and her children have got out. And from Poland they
all had tickets for a free train further west to Germany. These days the
evacuation is organised by volunteers. Among them I met an exuberant Frenchman
called Sebastian who was once in the foreign legion and is now in a tabard doing
crowd control. His family made him leave his passport at home so there'd be no
risk of him slipping across the border into Ukraine to join the fight. The
volunteers help the crowds to board, along with Arnold the Bulldog and a lot of
pet cats in cages. Other small bundles of belongings are squeezed into the
cabins and the windows steam up. The doors slam, Sebastian waves and cheers and
the train begins to slide from the station, carrying the refugees towards safety
but further from home. And a full year into this war none of them can be sure
when they're coming back. Sarah Rainsford. For so many people in Ukraine it's
hard to remember some cities as they once were, like Marupol and Bakumut.
Marupol, a city once celebrated for its culture with museum festivals, concerts
and a theatre, is now associated with ravaged buildings and a profound sense of
loss following the siege of the Azov steelworks and the bombing of the maternity
hospital. Bakumut is now the site of a protracted artillery battle with little
evidence of the community it once housed. For each Ukrainian coming to terms
with the present reality poses huge challenges, from rebuilding damaged
infrastructure to damaged homes and communities. Vitaly Shivchenko looks back on
a year of huge destruction in his homeland and the extraordinary spirit shown
through adversity. Vitaly Shivchenko. It has begun. I can hear explosions. The
whole house is shaking. My mother told me over the phone from Zapparizhia
through her tears. It was early in the morning and the Russian invasion had just
begun. I tried to calm her down the best I could, then I switched on my computer
to check the news and I saw Vladimir Putin announcing the start of his special
military operation. He sounded confident and relaxed but behind this facade it
was easy to see the unspeakable devastation that was about to be wreaked upon
the innocent. Yet the senseless cruelty, murder, torture, rape and destruction
that followed went beyond even what I had feared. Brutal actions which I thought
had been relegated to Europe's dark and distant past. I grew up in Ukraine and
that's where I lived until 2009. Together with most people in Russia and the
rest of the former Soviet Union we read the same books, watched the same films
and listened to the same songs. Some of my closest friends married Russians. So
how then can people have such close links, do such horrible things to each
other? One year after the war started I still don't know the answer. War brings
out the worst in people but also the best. For years after he was elected
President Zelensky wasn't really taken seriously by many. A comedian by
profession we thought he was in it only for the laughs. But after the invasion
of 2021 he found his inner warrior and is now widely regarded as a resolute
fighter for democracy. I was fortunate enough to be able to evacuate my parents
from eastern Ukraine and they were made to feel welcome back in England but I'm
painfully aware that others can't leave their homes or don't want to. Take my
friends from Zaporizia, Yuri, a keen photographer and a Depeche mode fan. When
we last had tea in his kitchen with his white cat hiding under the table, little
did we know that Yuri would have to leave all that behind to defend his city.
All my schoolmate Natalia, when we went boating on the River Dnieper one summer
evening, we had no idea that next year she would be cowering in her tiny flat
listening to the sound of explosions. Orviechislav, a historian and member of
the Zaporizia city council, who I first interviewed shortly after Russia invaded
in 2014. He spoke to me from a hospital bed after being wounded while defending
Donetsk airport. Eight years later he volunteered again and was killed fighting.
Now there's a street named after him in Zaporizia. It used to be named after
Mikhail Lermontov, the famous Russian poet. I'll take my friends from Russia
whose lives have been turned upside down by the turmoil. One a university worker
left Moscow for Turkey together with her son. Her husband left Moscow for a
village, fearing mobilization into the army. So where are we one year into the
special military operation? Ukraine's infrastructure has taken a battering and
so has Russia's standing in the world. But Ukraine and its culture are becoming
more popular. I've heard from an American truck driver learning Ukrainian while
on the move. In a sleepy English village, I've seen a poster explaining the
significance of Sonia Shnik, or sunflower, a symbol of Ukraine. President Putin
said he wanted to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine, thousands of whom are now
switching to speaking Ukrainian instead, refusing to watch Russian films or
listen to Russian music. He said he wanted to protect Russia's legacy. Russian
monuments are now being torn down in Ukraine. He said he wanted to demilitarize
Ukraine. It is now full of cutting edge Western weaponry. I last visited Ukraine
10 days before war broke out. People in the southern freewheeling port city of
Odessa seem determined to make the most of their lives despite the persistent
warnings of an imminent offensive. Launching it, President Putin said he was
ready for anything. But I can't help thinking he was not prepared for the
courage and resolve shown by Ukrainians in the face of a ruthless invader.
Vitaly Shevchenko. And that's all for today. We'll be back again on Saturday
morning. Do join us. From our own correspondent was presented by Kate Aidy. The
producer was Serena Tarling. And that's all for today. Exclusive performances by
much loved artists. Together with the BBC Concert Orchestra. From classic tracks
to brand new covers. Radio 2's piano. Watch on iPlayer. Listen on BBC Sounds.
Now on Radio 4 we continue our new arts documentary series. Each week we're
hearing stories from actors across the world who've all played the same part. In
today's episode it's Peter Pan. This is roleplay. So we are in the dressing
room. We're in the adults dressing room at St George's Theatre in Great Yarmouth
and I have just laid out my costume to have a look at. We have got some lovely
splits old jazz shoes that I've been given. They're amazing. They're great for
jumping around. I've got a very nice sort of Robin Hood S-cat with a nice
feather in it. Sort of green trim on that. And I guess the best piece that I've
got is this pretty amazing vest I've got here from Norwich Theatre Royal and it
is kind of embroidered with these amazing leaves all the way around it. And
they're different colours. You've got your reds, your oranges, your greens, your
browns and it just shows that connection to nature and this kind of almost wild
boy feeling that Peter Pan has. Where do you live? Second to the right and then
straight on till morning. What a funny address. No it isn't. You know there's
only one child that can stay young forever and that's Peter Pan. Good or bad?
One of the thrilling things about playing Peter Pan is stepping back into one's
own childhood. And it's brilliant for an actor to play because it's all about
being in the moment. I think Peter Pan actually saved my life. Every one of us
has a little bit of Peter Pan in us. I think I've got quite a lot of it really.
I'm Peter Pan. Every to pirates, prince of the seas, king of the skies. The most
incredible, unbeatable and logistical boy in all of Neverland. Neverland? That's
where I come from. Me and all the lost boys. Hello my name's Charlie Randall.
I'm playing Peter Pan at St George's Theatre in Great Yarmouth. I love doing
panto. If I could do pantomime every year for the rest of my life I probably
would. It's a lot of people's first experience of theatre, especially children
and it is just magic. When you look out at those tiny little young people who
are watching this show and they've got this look of awe and happiness on their
face, nothing beats it for me. I would say the best thing about playing Peter
Pan is it is such a well known character and it is such an almost archetypal
character. This boy who never grows up. It is literally all about putting as
much energy into it as possible. But it's quite useful as an actor because
you've got stuff to go on already when you take on the role. There is so many
versions of this story that can really help you. The whole thing is magical and
it's very difficult to put your finger on why it is such a wonderful experience
to play Peter Pan. He's ageless, he's a boy, but he's not completely. He's on
the brink of leaving childhood. A childhood for all of us, even if we've had
very, very unhappy difficult childhoods, there are magical things about being a
child. My next guest made her first movie at the age of 12 was signed up by Walt
Disney and became a world star in those dear departed days when child stars wore
pigtails and radiated innocence. Today she's matured into a splendid actress.
Ladies and gentlemen, Hayley Mills. My name is Hayley Mills and I played Peter
Pan in 1966 at the new Victoria cinema in London after having been under
contract for Walt Disney for six movies, which was a marvellous experience. And
I'm wanting very much to go on the stage. Playing Peter Pan really launched me
into working in the theatre in a wonderful way and it was very liberating. And I
think it was a really good choice because it was a part that I could really
identify with. You know, Jim Barry loved children. Children responded to his
marvellous imagination. You just feel very connected to him as well when you
play Peter Pan. Sir James Matthew Barry was the man who wrote Peter Pan. He was
also, by the turn of the century, one of the most prolific, rich and fashionable
of all British dramatists. Peter Pan appears only very briefly in The White
Bird, which was an early novel of Barry's. And then it's around about the time
that he sort of befriended the Llewelyn Davis family and they'd play games and
the idea emerged for Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn't grow up. And then he went
on to write it in a novel form again, Peter Pan and Wendy. But around Barry the
man there still hangs a kind of mystery. We know that he was unhappily married,
that he was childless and that in his middle years he virtually adopted five
young boys. They were the Llewelyn Davis brothers. The boys were, he claimed,
the inspiration for Peter Pan and for much of his other work. My name's Tristan
Thoreau. I played Peter Pan at the Bristol Old Vic in 2012. When we were doing
the show, the Queen came. Then I was asked if I could be in the dressing room
and have a chat with her. And it was bizarre because I was in this little tiny
room with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and some security guards outside.
And then I said, Your Majesty, is it true that Jane Barry used to read to you
when you were young? She said, Oh yes, yes. He came down to London, but he also
came to Balmoral and he would read to us. I think I was about seven at the time.
I said, Oh, that's incredible. And I said, What was he like? And she said, He
was an angry little man. And she kind of had a twinkle, but she was again, her
demeanor changed. And she said, Oh, he was an angry little man. The part of
Peter Pan seems to be to actresses, what Hamlet is to actors. They all want to
play it. And yet it can't be an easy role for not only do they have to portray a
boy, but a boy with a touch of magic and a boy moreover, who is so riddled with
whimsy that he confuses kisses with thimbles and thimbles with kisses. The first
Peter was Nina Busico. She created Peter and she did it a number of times. You
would ask him what he meant by such and such a passage. And he generally gave
you a most quizzical answer. One that you couldn't really reproduce such as when
I asked him what was Peter Pan and he told me that he was a bird and a day old.
That wasn't a very big thing to go on. But oh, it was so like that. Jean Forbes
Robertson also played Peter many times. She liked to to greet her guests when
they came to see her sitting on the mantelpiece and she had the mantelpiece
extended and made figures. So it was more like a big shelf. She could sit there.
It's such a wonderful image. Is it true? I don't know. Well now we've got boys
playing him as well, which, you know, why not? But at the same time, it's not
the Peter Pan that Barry imagined. To play Peter Pan is a recognition, an
accolade in anyone's career. And in any case, what actress could resist a part
where her first entrance has to come flying in through a window? Peter Pan
begins with the Darling family getting ready, the children to go to bed and the
parents to go out to dinner in the evening for his job. And Nana the dog is
watching them and there's a sense of foreboding from Mrs. Darling and she says,
dear nightlight that protects my sleeping children, burn clear and steadfast
tonight. She's a little bit afraid that something's going to happen. So the
children fall asleep and Tinkerbell slips through the window. She turns off all
the nightlights and all of a sudden you hear dun dun dun dun, the windows open,
dun dun dun, and Peter just flies through the air and the kids go, the flying is
actually one of the most exciting aspects of Peter Pan. It gets me every time,
you know, and I know how it's done. When I did it, to get your wire attached,
you would have to back into the wings and stand looking unconcerned while
someone fiddled around hooking you up. And then you would walk back and you'd
find the right spot and then a Kirby flying guy would jump off the ladder and up
you would go. The first few times I was kind of terrified, but like the sort of
terrified when you're on a roller coaster and you're like, oh my God, I'm going
to die. In our productions, instead of fairy dust, we said, I'm just going to
put my fairy strings on. So you declare it, which is sort of true to the spirit
of what Barry was doing when he first performed those plays. And when it's
declared and so obvious and seen, I think it becomes magical. I think every
child wants to fly, but, and I'm not quite sure what it is except that it's just
like they want to go to. I've had some really great moments with children. We
were at our theater, we've had like the Make A Wish Foundation bring children in
to fly. And we had one little girl that was in a wheelchair and I was in a Peter
Pan costume and she's very sick, you could tell, but she wanted to fly. That was
her wish to fly. So I put her in a harness that goes over your shoulders and
through your legs. And as I look at her, I thought she looked like she was going
to cry and I thought, honey, you don't have to do this. I said, are you okay?
She goes, so I said, think lovely, wonderful thoughts. And I threw the fairy
dust on her and she started to ascend very slowly, but and carefully. And as she
got up and started going from one side to the other of the brusinium hall, she
said, look at me, mommy, I'm finally free. My name is Kathy Rigby McCoy and I
have played Peter Pan over 3000 times. Peter Pan is about a mythical little boy
who has all the characteristics of any child, but he goes to this magical place,
Neverland, where he can have everything that he wants and he can fly and he can
fight the bad guys and always win. He can come and go as he pleases. And the
only thing he doesn't have is the love of a family, friends that actually stay
with him. So he continually uses his imagination to recreate his life and he
learns to shut down emotionally, but he always has fun. And, you know, there's
only one child that can stay young forever and that's Peter Pan, good or bad. I
competed in gymnastics from the age of 10 till I was 20. I made my first
Olympics in Mexico City at 15. Gymnastics was not a big sport in the United
States at that point. And I think being the first American to place as high as I
did in the 68 Olympics was very unusual and I was only 15. So there was a story
there, you know. I went on to compete in the Munich Olympics in 1972 and then at
the ripe old age of 19, I retired from the sport and had to figure out what I
wanted to do the rest of my life. I think Peter Pan actually, after I retired
from gymnastics, saved my life. It was one of those roles that, you know,
demands spontaneity and creativity in a way that I had not experienced in my
childhood because I was very disciplined and very, you know, focused on what I
had to do and not emotional. I first played Peter Pan in 1974 in an arena
version of the show and the last time I played it, I was 59 years old. I'd
worked with Sally Cookson, the director of Peter Pan at Bristol, on a production
of Treasure Island and she then approached me and said, look, we're thinking of
doing Peter Pan. And I immediately thought, oh, great, Captain Hook. And then
she phoned me back a few days later and said, so, so, yes, so we'd love you to
sort of look at Peter. I was 40 and thinking, oh, OK, fantastic. Brilliant.
Sally was very interested and we were all interested in the darkness that
surrounds somebody who doesn't grow up. I did the musical Peter Pan always, but
I always felt like it was a play with music. And the more I read the Jamesbury
novels and all the books, there were so many wonderful moments that I could draw
from. And to this day, one of my favorite quotes from Peter Pan is when Mrs.
Darling watches her daughter in a garden and when he picks up a flower and gives
it to her mother, then Mrs. Darling says, oh, if only they could remain like
this forever. And having watched my children grow up, now have grandchildren, I
sometimes think, oh, God, if only they could remain like this forever. The key
moments for me that I remember of that production was there's a nightmare scene
where he has these dreams of his life before and that sense of abandonment by
his mother, where he goes away and he comes back and the window was barred. And
there's such a deep sort of tragedy in that. The very core of him is this
rejection and so therefore he will never grow up. Peter Pan is classic, real
classic tragic hero because he's cursed by the fact that he can't grow up. And
it's brilliant for an actor to play because on the stage it's all about being in
the moment. As a clown, for instance, you are in a state of innocence where
you're continually forgetting what's gone before and what's in the future.
You're literally living in the present. And that is the state that Peter is
consistently in. If anything goes wrong, it's a gift and that's fantastic and
you can use it and it's a continual adventure. So there's so many parallels.
There's so many things that tie in with the state of that play for a performer.
I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun. Now then, no fuss, no
blubbering. I hope you will like your mothers. Are you ready Tink? Then lead the
way. I was an ice skater back in the day when I was short and flexible and I was
in the scanning atlas figure skating club in upstate New York. And the club
every year put on a big ice show and they needed a very small child who could
also do a camel spin, which is the thing where you sort of make a spiral out of
your body and spin. And I was the smallest kid who could do it. So I got to be
Tinkerbell. My name is Alison Kavey. I'm a professor of history at City
University of New York, John Jay College and the Graduate Center. And I co-
edited Second Star to the right, Peter Pan in the Popular Imagination with Les
Friedman. My name is Les Friedman. I'm the emeritus professor and former chair
of the Media and Society Program at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and was
the co-author of this book. I found something quite different. I'm quite sure
all of you know the story of Peter Pan and Wendy very well indeed. Well, Walt
Disney has made a cartoon film of it, which is on general release now. And in
the piece that we're going to show you... Bobby Driscoll was the voice of Peter
Pan in Disney's 1953 version. And that was perhaps along with Treasure Isle in
his most famous role. And ironically, he wasn't seen. The second star to the
right shines in the night for you. Bobby Driscoll was the voice of Peter Pan in
the movie when he was 16 years old, went through an incredible change that's
unfortunately not particularly aberrational in Hollywood with child stars. By
the time he was nine years old, he was a movie star. But I want to thank
everybody that had to do with me getting this award. I want to thank God for
giving me such a wonderful mother and father. Thank you. He actually won a
juvenile Oscar when he was 12 years old. He was the voice of Peter Pan when he
was 16 years old. And he was dead by the time he was 31 years old, best guest
being as a heroin overdose. So my interest in Bobby Driscoll is, I think, in his
body as one that was ruined by adolescence for film and therefore was deemed
unacceptable to put on camera. And then he lost his career and lost his way as a
result. If he could have stayed a child, he probably would have had a career.
But instead he became an adult, a teenager with an incredibly bad case of acne
that they could not somehow cover enough for him to be able to make the
transition, if he could, into adult roles. Of course, he turned to the Never
Never Land of heroin, which allowed him to participate in the real world as
opposed to the Hollywood world. The fact that children found his dead body after
he overdosed and died is perhaps the most compelling narrative arc of a real
story I've ever seen, because a lost boy who became a lost man was found by
children playing in a lost space, right? This was an abandoned house where his
dead body was found. He was indigent by that point. No one knew who he was. He
was buried in Potter's Field, which is the graveyard of paupers. A person whose
body and voice were made immortal by the Disney film and whose movements were
associated with eternal youth, with eternal lightness, with a flippancy and joy
then became nothing but a corpse, the leftovers of an adult person. It reflects
for me the very dark potential or the flip side of all that lightness and joy.
There is this moment in the play when Tinkerbell who adores Peter Pardon is with
him all the time and in the play she's depicted as a light and the pirate's
Captain Hook tries to poison Peter and she drinks it to stop him drinking it.
She goes back to her little house and she's lying on her little bed and her
little light is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. Her light's growing
faint. If it goes out, that means she's dead. Her voice is so low I can scarcely
tell what she's saying. And Peter's desperate and he turns to the children and
the audience. She says she thinks she could get well again if children believed
in fairies. He says if you believe in fairies and you clap your hands, this will
give Tinkerbell great strength and she will come back to life. So when a
clapping starts in the audience, the applause grows to an absolute roar and the
little light starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger. Oh, thank you, thank
you. Gosh, you know, it's really emotional and I think about it now and I'm
feeling quite emotional. I think my mother told me about Peter Pan when I was
younger and I'm sure as a kid, like I had watched the cartoon somewhere, the
Disney one. And the concept of this boy who didn't want to go gold was, I mean,
Peter Pan was always, I was quite a big part of my childhood when I was younger.
But then I didn't know the history of it until I came here to England. It's a
dreadful irony that Peter Pan's first audience included a lot of boys who didn't
grow up because of course they were killed in the First World War like one of
the Llewelyn Davis boys himself. Barry lived through that and he must at times
have felt in a sense the play had been prophesying it. Peter Pan was performed
every year through the war. The theatre filled not with children but with
soldiers home from the trenches. The line, to die will be an awfully big
adventure, was left out for the duration. That really struck a chord because I
was born in 85 and during that time there was a civil war that was going on in
Sri Lanka too. My name is Hirana Besekar. I'm from Sri Lanka. I came over to
England in 2008. It was the first time that I was on a plane and I came for
auditions. I graduated from Rada and then I did Peter Pan at Regent's Park Open
Air Theatre in 2015 and it was awesome. Most of my childhood there was always
this major thing happening at the background and during news broadcasts after
the weather report it would always end with the body count which is such a weird
way to grow up really. But I related to the Lost Boys because there were quite a
few of my friends who later on joined the army as well and I kind of understood
it, you know, how they are lost when they get back. There's like a sort of
vacant look in their eyes. So the theatre itself is the heart of Regent's Park.
It's surrounded by huge trees. It's open air and I think it sits about like a
thousand people maybe even a little bit more and around when the sun goes down
and the lights come on it's like the most magical place really to like do
theatre. Tim Sheeda and Liam Steele were the directors and they focused a lot on
World War I. We had a group of East 15 boys who were the soldiers and they were
there all throughout the play in different parts of the play and sort of set the
scene really. And at the end of the play I remember the boys sort of walk into
the sort of sunset and one of Wendy's brothers walks with them and that's quite
heartbreaking every time. I mean it's a what I mean how many people were lost
during that time and all these boys who were promised adventure and they were
kids who hadn't even like left the country and suddenly they were like can you
imagine of course they were lost. To be honest with you, having watched all the
films recently and then coming to do this pantomime I'd kind of forgotten the
end because you think of it all ending happily because I had remembered that
Wendy and her brothers end up back home but you kind of forget that Peter Pan is
almost left on his own, left back in Neverland. Yeah it's kind of quite sad that
he's the only one who doesn't really get to go back with his parents and that's
been quite an interesting thing to play as well but bearing in mind it is a
pantomime, we're kind of putting a positive spin on that. Good night Peter, good
night Wendy, Peter you won't forget me will you? I decided to stop playing Peter
Pan because after 3000 times I thought that was a good amount I would have every
memory I could possibly have of the show and also it was me being Wendy saying
you know I have to let this part go. At 59 I would meet children after the show
and I found myself you know kind of going mmm and I had a little boy who said I
really like you, you're really good as Peter Pan and I love how you fly and this
and that and then he came up close to us but as I get up close I see you have
wrinkles and I just thought leave it to a child to kind of tell you when to get
out. I don't want to lose the sense of humour or the spontaneity, I don't want
to lose Peter Pan, I don't want to lose that part of myself but I don't need to
play the part to still keep him in my heart. Roleplay was produced by Sam Grist
